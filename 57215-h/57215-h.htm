<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p>The material in this small volume was collected
in connexion with the Linacre Lecture at St.
John’s College, Cambridge, and has been
somewhat expanded since its delivery on 6th
May 1922. The introduction is chiefly of
local interest in connexion with the history of
the Linacre Lecture. Without attempting a
complete account of old age and its diseases I
have passed in review some ancient and modern
medical aspects of this subject, but, except for
incidental references, medical treatment has not
been considered.</p>

<p>For ready help, especially as regards the
illustrations, my cordial thanks are due to
C. J. S. Thompson, Esq., M.B.E., of the
Wellcome Historical Museum, and for the
index I am much indebted to H. M. Barlow,
Esq., Assistant Librarian of the Royal College
of Physicians of London.</p>

<p>The Linacre Foundation dating from 1524 is
the oldest medical Lectureship in the University,
for it was sixteen years later that the
Regius Professorship of Physic was established
by Henry VIII. Formerly this College Lectureship
was held more or less indefinitely by
Fellows of the College, with two eminent exceptions,
namely, Sir George Paget and Dr.
J. B. Bradbury; but in 1908 the Lectureship
was made an annual and open appointment, and
until this year no member of the College has
held this office: I am therefore most deeply
conscious of the high honour that has been
conferred upon me.</p>

<p>Though the statute that the Lecturer should
explain Galen’s treatises <cite>De Sanitate Tuenda</cite>
and <cite>De Methodo Medendi</cite> as translated by
Linacre, or <cite>De Elementis et Simplicibus</cite>, has long
lapsed, his first words should be directed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
the pious memory of the founder; but as in
1908 the late Sir William Osler<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> devoted the
first of the new series of Linacre Lectures to
a sympathetic consideration of his brother
scholar-physician, it would be worse than unwise
to attempt more than the briefest reference.</p>

Sir William Beechey, R.A.</p></div></div>

<p>Thomas Linacre (1460–1524) was born at
Canterbury of parents who have eluded research,
and his connexion with the old family that
took its name (Linacre = flax farmer) from
a hamlet near Chesterfield in Derbyshire was
regarded by J. F. Payne as merely an assumption.
Believing that those devoted to learning
should be free from the obligations of the
married state Linacre remained single, so that
he had no direct descendants; his will<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a>
contains references to his brother, who had the
same Christian name—Thomas—as himself,
two sisters Alice and Joan, two nieces Agnes
and Margaret, and two cousins Robert Wright
of Chester and Richard Wright; but according
to Payne<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> the family history cannot be traced
any further. I recently had a faint hope that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
I had got on the track of collateral descendants,
but on enquiry it was courteously made clear
that though the family in question was descended
from a Mrs. Linnecar, her connexion with
T. Linacre rested on tradition only and that
no documentary evidence or genealogical tree
existed to justify any claim. It may be
remembered that Linacre was one of the
earliest English students (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">circa</i> 1488), more
than a century before William Harvey, to
study medicine and take the doctorate at the
ancient University of Padua, which celebrated
its seven-hundredth anniversary in May 1922.
It is, next, natural to look back to the first
holder of this Lectureship, and to wonder
what manner of man he was and what he taught.
To the Master of St. John’s College I am
indebted for the few details that are known
of Christopher Jackson (B.A. 1524–25, M.A.
1527), who was buried in the old Chapel on
July 2, 1528, his death according to a brass
erected to his memory in the new antechapel
being “e sudore britanico.”<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> Some of the
Lecturers were without a medical qualification,
and of these Matthew Prior (1664–1721), the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
poet and diplomatist, who was a “Medical
Fellow” for life and Linacre Lecturer from
July 5, 1706, to July 7, 1710, was the most
famous. That he ever lectured is more than
doubtful, but he appears to have thought out
reasons for not doing so: at any rate his <cite>Alma
or the Progress of the Mind</cite> (written about 1715)
contains in its third canto the lines:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i14">how could I explain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The various labyrinths of the brain!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Surprise my readers whilst I tell them<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of cerebrum and cerebellum!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How could I play the commentator<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On dura and on pia mater!<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Three of the Linacre Lecturers under
the old dispensation stand out for special
remembrance on account of their influence
on Medicine:</p>

<p>William Heberden the Elder (1710–1801),
the author of the <cite xml:lang="la" lang="la">Commentarii de Morborum
Historia et Curatione</cite>, published posthumously
(1802), held office from 1734–38, and was
described by Sir William Osler as the “English
Celsus.”<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></p>

Sir Thomas Watson (1792–1882), whose
<cite>Lectures on Physic</cite> held its place longer than
any medical text-book of modern times and
set an example of style that still commands
our admiration and imitation, was Lecturer
1822–26, and in the first year of office was
also a Proctor. Subsequently (1862–67), he
was President of the Royal College of Physicians
of London, the most magnificent of Linacre’s
Foundations; this appropriate association was
shared by William Baronsdale (P.R.C.P. 1589–1600),
by Thomas Gisborne, who was President
on three separate occasions (1791, 1794, 1796–1804)
alternately with his senior Sir George
Baker, and by Sir Norman Moore of St.
Catherine’s College (P.R.C.P. 1918–22), who
gave the Linacre Lecture under the new
regulations in 1913 on <cite>The Physician in
English History</cite>.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></p>

<p>John Haviland (1785–1851), the only one
of these three who remained in Cambridge,
and the only one who did not become a nonagenarian,
was Linacre Lecturer for two periods
(1817–22, 1826–47), Sir Thomas Watson<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
intervening. As Professor of Anatomy (not
human anatomy) from 1814–17 he delivered
the first regular course of lectures on human
anatomy; and when he succeeded Sir Isaac
Pennington (also Linacre Lecturer, 1767–1816)
as Regius Professor of Physic (1817–51)
he was the first to give courses in pathology
and the practice of medicine, thus rousing the
post from the sleep of a sinecure, and to make
the medical examinations a real and rigid test
instead of little more than a farcical form
consisting of a few <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">viva voce</i> questions. Further,
had it not been for his influence and insistence
the medical faculty might have been abolished,
and it was said<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> after his death that the subsequent
success of the medical school was due
to his exertions. He wrote little and perhaps
for that reason his name is seldom mentioned
now, but if the work that has since been done
by this medical school be his monument he
could hardly have a greater.</p>

<p>The somewhat neglected subject of Old Age
has a very pertinent connexion with the most
essential aim of medicine as a whole, namely,
the prevention of disease. For when the ideal
of the prophylaxis of infection and of other
causes of morbid action is attained, a healthy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
old age and physiological death without attendant
disabilities and horrors should be the common
lot of man instead of being somewhat exceptional
in the case of the first and extremely
rare as regards the final act. The conditions
favouring longevity and <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">mens sana in corpore
sano</i> are those necessary to make the future
of the human race a happy and beneficent
prospect instead of a problem inspiring doubt
if not pessimism; or in Descartes’ words,
“we might be free of an infinity of maladies
both of body and mind, and even of the
infirmities of old age, if we had sufficient
knowledges of their causes and remedies.”
But in addition to this broad ground of interest
there are reasons why a discussion of this
subject has a special claim for consideration
in Cambridge. The objects of a University
include the preparation of its alumni for life
in its fullest and best sense, and from this
point of view the permanent ornaments of the
community ever set an unobtrusive example
of the way to deserve and enjoy a healthy,
happy, and useful old age, namely, activity of
mind and body and moderation in all things;
such a life of 75 years (that of Professor G. D.
Liveing) in the University must be in your
recollection as described by the Public Orator<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
as <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">tam honesta, tam utilis</i>. Further, as in
private duty bound, I cannot forget that Sir
George Humphry, to whom this great medical
school owes so much, greatly interested himself
in the subject of old age and published the
results of an elaborate collective investigation.
Lastly, it is desirable that the problems of old
age should be attacked by young and active
minds in the laboratories of the University and
not left as a semi-personal field of enquiry and
observation to those whose “way of life is
fall’n into the sere, the yellow leaf,” and who
hear old age’s stealthy footsteps catching them
up in the race; for in the past most of the
writers on geriatrics have written with at least
some personal qualification and interest, such
as Cornaro, Sir John Sinclair, Sir Anthony
Carlisle, Charcot, Sir George Humphry, Sir
Hermann Weber, R. Saundby, Metchnikoff,
Stanley Hall. As an exception, however, we
may point to Dr. John Smith,<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> who, in his thirty-fifth
year, was the author of <cite>King Solomon’s
Portraicture of Old Age</cite>, which paraphrases in
266 pages the “six former” verses of the 12th
Chapter of Ecclesiastes containing 205 words.</p>

<span class="subhead">DURATION OF LIFE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>In the protozoa and some other lowly forms
of animal life multiplication by binary fission
occurs indefinitely, so that one organism is
succeeded by two, and as there is no vestige
of a corpse, as Weissmann expressed it, the
organism is immortal. Maupas’s<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> investigations
indicated that without occasional conjugation
of two individual protozoa and the
resulting rejuvenation the organisms undergo
senile degeneration and die; but Woodruff<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a>
has shown by observations extending over 13½
years that <i>Paramoecium</i>, and so presumably
infusoria in general, can multiply indefinitely
in favourable conditions without conjugation,
though periodically an internal reorganization
(endomixis<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a>) of the individual takes place. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
seems not improbable that endomixis provides
the rejuvenation otherwise resulting from conjugation.
C. M. Child<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> brings forward reasons
for modification of the explanation that death
is escaped simply by division; he shows that
in certain circumstances senescence occurs in
the protozoa as it does in the higher animals,
but that death is avoided by the rejuvenescence
in each process of reproduction, reconstitution
occurring and new organs being formed in the
place of the old. In other words, all organisms
from the protozoa to man undergo senescence
and die unless rejuvenescence intervenes; this
compensation holds good in the lower forms
and death may never occur; but in the higher
forms rejuvenescence is so much restricted by
the evolutionary increase in the physiological
stability of the protoplasmic substratum and
the resulting higher degree of individuation
that senescence is much more continuous and
death is inevitable. It is the penalty for high
individuation, and is the result of conditions
and processes that have produced the complicated
mechanism of the higher animals and
man. While holding out the faint hope that
the advance of knowledge and of experimental
technique may make it possible at some future<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
time to bring about a greater rejuvenescence
and retardation of senescence in man and the
higher animals, Child points out that the
present condition of their protoplasmic substratum
is the result of millions of years of
evolutionary equilibration, and that this task
must therefore be one of extreme difficulty.</p>

<p>Modern biologists such as Driesch, E.
Schultz, Child, Steinach, and Julian S. Huxley,
to the last of whom I am personally much in
debt, have indeed shown that experimentally
the life cycle and growth, which are so closely
correlated, may be modified dramatically by
various methods. By starvation planarian flat
worms become smaller and their life cycle is
reversed by the process variously called dedifferentiation,
reduction, or involution, whereby
their structure becomes simpler; similar retrogressive
changes have been produced in the
social ascidians, <cite>Clavellina and Perophora</cite> (J. S.
Huxley<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a>), this process of dedifferentiation or
reversible differentiation being the primitive
reaction of organisms to unfavourable circumstances.
By alternate feeding and starvation
Child has kept planarian flat worms at the
same size while controls passed through nineteen
generations, thus showing that the life of cells<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
is not a matter of time but of metabolism. In
the higher animals the conditions are of course
more complex on account of the self-regulating
mechanisms, especially the ductless glands.
But by disturbing the endocrine balance experimental
biology has produced some remarkable
results: by feeding white mice with
tethelin (a phospholipin obtained from the
anterior lobe of the pituitary) Robertson and
Ray<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> found that epithelial proliferation was
accelerated, though increase in weight of the
animals was retarded, and that the duration of
life was prolonged. Drummond and Cannan,<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a>
however, failed to confirm these results, and
feeding with the anterior lobe of the pituitary
has given rise to very contradictory reports;
acceleration (Clark, Robertson, Goetsch), retardation
(Pearl, Wulzen), and no effect (Gudernatsch,
Lewis and Miller, Hoskins, Sisson and
Broyles<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a>) have been described. Steinach’s
rejuvenation of senile rats by ligature of the
vas deferens, which is followed by increase in
the interstitial cells of the testis and definite
prolongation of life, will be referred to later<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
(<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">vide</i> p. 76). The retardation of growth due
to a diet deficient in vitamins, first proved
by Gowland Hopkins<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> in 1912, may be
maintained for long periods, but when the diet
is appropriately altered growth is resumed and
proceeds to the full standard (Osborne and
Mendel<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a>); it remains to be proved that the
total duration of life can thus be prolonged.
Though every living species of animal may in
normal circumstances have its allotted span of
life, this is so subject to accidents and modifications
by external influences that the average
duration of existence, especially in the long-lived
species, does not represent the natural
term of years. Thus the expectation of life
at birth in England and Wales is 51·5 years
for males and 55·35 years for females, as
contrasted with the ideal physiological duration
of life for 100 years. Violent death in one
form or another—traumatic or infective—is so
much the rule that the occurrence of natural
death in the animal kingdom has been questioned,
just as de Candolle denied the natural
death of trees and ascribed it to injury or
disease. Metchnikoff,<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> who paid special attention<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
to this question, described natural death
in the Ephemerids, day-flies, the imagines of
which are incapable of feeding and after an
hour or two of “aerial life devoted to love”
die, their ova falling into the water; Sir Ray
Lankester accepts the view that they are
“wound up” for a few hours only of life, but
according to Child death is probably due to
starvation. In man natural death from old
age—a physiological ending—is very rare,
much less frequent indeed than death certificates
and ordinary parlance would suggest;
for in such cases there is very commonly some
latent disease, such as pneumonia, which just
turns the scale in the trembling balance.
Montaigne warns us “what an idle conceit it
is to expect to die of a decay of strength, which
is the last of the effects of the extremest age,
and to propose to ourselves no shorter lease of
life than that, considering that it is a kind of
death of all others the most rare and hardly ever
seen.” While it must be admitted that this
still holds good, it is a stimulus to our efforts
to render it no longer true.</p>

<p>The length of days ascribed to Methuselah
(969), Adam (930 or, if the “conceit urged
by learned men,” as Sir Thomas Browne<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
says, that he was 50 or 60 years old when called
into being be accepted, 980 years), Seth (912),
has aroused attempts at explanation on the
basis of a difference in chronology. The
suggestion that the “years” were lunar and
not solar, in other words containing 30 instead
of 365 days, was controverted at length by
Eugenius Philalethes<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> (not Thomas, twin of
Henry Vaughan “the Silurist”) as too radical,
for on this interpretation some of the patriarchs
would have become fathers of children before
they were ten years old. Long ago, Hensler,
following Justin, put forward the view that the
year consisted of but three months up to the
time of Abraham, when it was extended to
eight months until the era of Joseph, after
which it contained our full complement of
twelve months. This explanation was supported
by Hufeland<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> on the ground that
some eastern nations still reckoned three
months to the year. Adopting this explanation
Methuselah’s age would be cut down
to 243 years.</p>

<p>The Psalmist’s threescore years and ten and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
its sorrowful extension to fourscore are so
often exceeded by human beings who appear
normal that the possibility of a far longer
existence has often been raised. John Sterne
or Stearne (1624–69) who, though founder of
the Irish College of Physicians, was, according
to Mahaffy,<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> more of a theologian than a
physician, believed that there was no reason
why men should not live as long as the patriarchs
before the Flood; but he also argued that these
patriarchal ages must have been exceptional,
for had all the human beings between the
Creation and the Flood, a period of more than
1400 years, lived to an average breeding age
of 400 years and begun, as did the patriarchs,
to beget children at the rate of one male every
three years, the population of the earth could
not have found standing room on its surface;
his colleague in Trinity College, Dublin, Miles
Symner, Professor of Mathematics, provided
him with a calculation showing that there
would have been less than one cubic foot
available for each individual. This seems to
be echoed in a slightly different connexion by
Weissmann’s conception of natural death as
due to natural selection and as an adaptation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
for the good of the species, the degenerated
organisms being no longer fertile or useful,
an hypothesis hardly necessary, as Metchnikoff
points out, when degeneration which is the
prelude to dissolution has appeared. Roger
Bacon<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> stating that man, originally immortal
and after the Fall able to live for a thousand
years, had his life gradually abbreviated by
corruption of his own making, believed that it
should be possible by taking care as to regimen
to prolong life for a hundred or more years
than the common duration. Since the time
of Aristotle the vital cycle has been thought to
be a multiple of the period of growth. Francis
Lord Bacon considered that animals in general
should live eight times as long as they take to
come to maturity, and Hufeland,<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> adopting
this principle, and regarding 25 years as
the termination of adolescence, concluded that
man’s natural span should be 200 years.
Buffon took 14 years as the age of puberty,
and multiplying it by 7 decided that human
life should naturally be 100 years. Assuming
that union of the epiphyses of the long bones
marked the time when growth was finally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
completed, Flourens<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> calculated that throughout
the animal kingdom life was five times as
long, and that as in man the epiphyses united at
20 or 21 years of age the span of human
life should be 100 years.</p>

<p>More modern estimates of the duration of
human life under ideal conditions of protection
against infection have been to the same effect,
thus conforming to the estimate of Cornaro,<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a>
who died at that age, that a hundred years was
“the time allowed to man by God and nature.”
Metchnikoff,<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> while admitting that there must
be variations, considered that man should live
more than 100 years, and Luciani fixed the
physiological duration of life at 100 years.
Ebstein’s (1891) estimate of 70 years as the
usual duration of life, which is the age at
which the maximum number of deaths occur
when the first few years of life are excluded,
is different from the ideal duration under the
best physiological conditions and corresponds
more or less with B. W. Richardson’s rough
rule that the individual’s probable age at
death can be arrived at by taking the average<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
of the ages of his parents and grandparents;
in this procedure the important factor of
heredity is taken into account, and the disturbing
part played by accidents and infections in
modifying the ideal expectation of life is to
some extent neutralized by taking the average
of the six lives.</p>

<p>Although 100 years may be regarded as the
physiological life of man it is rarely reached,
and one of several reasons is that the physiological
requirements for this apparently exaggerated
term of years are very seldom
provided. Sir Ray Lankester<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> suggested that
just as giants in stature are exceptional variations
so centenarians should be regarded in
the same light, as giants in years instead of in
inches. He meets the obvious objection that
whereas the parents of giants are of normal
height, longevity and centenarianism appear
to run in families, by doubting if the actual
quality of potential long life is transmitted and
by ascribing family longevity to the inheritance
of traditions and habits favourable to long
life. In this connexion it should be remembered
that many giants are pathological
and due to acromegaly, whereas unusual height,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
over six feet, certainly runs in families;
analogy therefore makes it reasonable to believe
that length of days, like length in inches, may
run in families, although these two approaches
to giantism very seldom occur in the same
individual.</p>

<p>The authenticity of persons alleged to be
of great age rightly excites critical examination,
and some of the most famous examples, such
as Henry Jenkins (169), Thomas Parr (152¾),
Katherine, Countess of Desmond (145), as
Sir George Cornewall Lewis and Mr. W. Thom
showed, as well as many of the 1712 centenarians
in James Easton’s<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> list covering the
years <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 66 to 1799, cannot be regarded as
established.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> In the same category we must
place Petrasch Zorten (1537–1724), whose
portrait at the reputed age of 185 was reproduced
by Sir John Sinclair.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> Old people take
a natural pride in their age and tend to exaggerate
it; according to Mr. G. King<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> the
excess in the census returns of persons over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
91 and the deficit in those between 85 and 90
years of age could only be explained by the conclusion
that the temptation to overstate the age
so as to appear among the nonagenarians had not
been resisted. The vast majority of centenarians
are naturally among the bulk of the population,
namely, the poor, among whom natural selection
is provided with a correspondingly greater
opportunity of finding those “vigorous frames
which promise a long life,” and in these circumstances
the means of checking the exact age
may be less easy than in the case of the well-to-do.</p>

<p><i>Sex.</i>—Females are more long-lived than
males; the 1911 census for England and
Wales shows that after 10 years of age there
are more females than males living in all the
quinquennial periods, the proportion of females
progressively increasing until at the age of 85
and upwards there are 645 females to 355
males in 1000 living at that age group. Among
centenarians also the ratio of the sexes is much
in favour of that popularly said to be the
weaker. Out of the 691 reputed centenarian
deaths registered in England and Wales during
the 10 years 1910–19 inclusive, 504, or 73
per cent, were females, and 187, or 27 per
cent, males. But during the same period in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
Ireland the disproportion was much less:
among the 945 reputed centenarian deaths
545, or 58 per cent, were females, and 400,
or 42 per cent, males. It has been said,
though without sufficient statistical evidence,
that although the female sex is favourable to
longevity extreme length of days is attained
only by males. The superior longevity of
the female sex, in spite of the risks attaching
to child-birth, depends on several factors, such
as an existence less exposed to accident and
infection, a more temperate life, and in
addition, so Sir George Humphry argued,
on a stronger inherent vitality, for during the
first year of life when there is no difference as
regards the first two circumstances more boys
than girls succumb. The higher male death
rate in the first year of life, however, may be
partly due to a mechanical cause, namely, the
large size of the male infant’s head, as a result
of which the numerical superiority of male
infants born is reduced by the effects of trauma.
Another factor is, perhaps, that old women do
not feel so old as old men do, and that therefore
auto-suggestion plays a less powerful part with
them.</p>

<p>The question must arise as to what is the
object of the prolongation of life after the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
reproductive function has waned as it does in
women—the more long-lived of the sexes—about
half-way through the physiological term
of years. In some lower animals life terminates
very shortly after propagation of the species
has been effected; but this is not the rule, and
the biological meaning of the continuation of
the life of individuals that but cumber the
ground and may lead a parasitic existence
requires explanation, though educational advantages
and moral lessons may undeniably be
provided by healthy old age with its store of
what a Cambridge man, now justly famous,
described in his rather rebellious youth as
“that greatly over-rated property experience.”
It has been suggested by Sir Ray Lankester that
the inherent property resulting in longevity
may be bound up as a “correlated variation”
with some other characteristic useful in the
struggle for existence and the perpetuation of
the species. An obvious possibility is that
the long-lived have a higher fertility rate than
average mortals. Hufeland<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> argued that as
very old people are nearly always married more
than once and generally at a very late period
of life “a certain abundance in the power of
generation is favourable to longevity.” There<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
are few satisfactory data to determine the
converse proposition with which we are now
concerned, namely, is longevity accompanied
by unusual fertility? As already mentioned,
the great majority of centenarians are found
among the bulk of the population, namely the
poor, who are far more prolific than the well-to-do;
but this does not prove much, for the
inverse correlation of fertility and good social
status is largely artificial and due to voluntary
birth control. Among the 824 persons between
80 and 100 years of age analysed by Sir George
Humphry<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> in 1889 there were 335 married
men and 292 married women, and in each
group the average number of children was six,
which is somewhat in excess of what is popularly
supposed to be the average size of a family;
but the question of average fertility is one on
which Dr. Major Greenwood warns me that
it is difficult to give an unambiguous answer,
for it all depends on whether completed or
incompleted fertilities are meant; thus in the
1911 census the completed fertilities average
5·8 and the uncompleted 4·2. No value could,
he considers, be attached to the general figure
obtained by dividing the total number of
children by the total number of couples<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
enumerated. Hence Sir George Humphry’s
and other statistics are not really comparable.
While finding that longevity was equally
shared by the single and married women and
by those who had children and by those who
were barren, Sir George Humphry stated
that among those who had children fertility
was associated with longevity.</p>

<span class="subhead">ONSET OF OLD AGE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The onset of old age varies in different countries,
and, like the development of puberty, is
accelerated by the high temperature of tropical
countries. There is also considerable variation
in families and individuals of the same race
and country; thus while one man may be
senile at 60 years of age another is vigorous
both in mind and body at 80. The inconstancy
of onset depends on the various factors that
may play a causal part; old age may be a
physiological involution, but too often is a
pathological product. When the period of
reproductive power (maturity) wanes that of
old age begins; in women this is marked by
the menopause, the age of 45 years being taken
as the limit of fertility, but before this even
in the late thirties the spectre of fading attractiveness
may upset the matron and lead to the
irregularities of the “dangerous age.” For
man there is no such index, and the change is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
so insidious that most of us would expostulate
at Stanley Hall’s<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> statement that old age in
men begins in the early forties and sooner in
women, or less than half-way through the
physiological lifetime of a hundred years.
According to Dante 45 marks the termination
of youth, and it seems generally agreed that
as a rule—and every one is entitled to consider
himself as the <span class="locked">exception—</span></p>

<p>It has from analogy of the female sex been
rather fancifully suggested that in man there
occurs about the age of fifty a critical period
(<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">climacterium virile</i>) due to changes in the sex
glands (Mendel<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a>) or prostate (Rankin<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a>); but
of this there is no proof. It recalls as a kind
of echo the ancient conceptions of the grand
climacterics at 49 (a multiple of the number
7), 63 (7 × the magical number 9 of the
Arabians), and 81, and the description in 1807
by Professor B. Waterhouse<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> of Cambridge,
Mass., who in 1800 introduced Jennerian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
vaccination into America, of a kind of male
moulting between 43 and 50 and a worse one
at 63, an idea expanded into the climacteric
disease imagined in 1813 by Sir Henry
Holland.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> There is indeed no doubt that
after an illness, and the so-called climacteric
disease admittedly seldom occurred without
some previous factor such as an attack of gout,
a common cold, a bout of intemperance,
recent marriage, or particularly grief or bereavement,
old age may come on apace. In some
instances the so-called climacteric disease was
perhaps really chronic renal disease, in others
merely the prolonged or imperfect convalescence
due to some lingering infection after an acute
illness, such as influenza; and, as in the
latter case recovery may occur, Holland’s
contention that recovery was an argument in
favour of the existence of this climacteric
disease holds good only in distinguishing it
from permanent senility, which indeed was
the objection that he was concerned to meet.
The conception of the climacteric disease is
interesting historically only; and it may be
agreed that apart from accidents of environment
the progress of senescence in healthy men
is gradual and uneventful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
So stealthy is the onset of senescence that
commonly it is not recognized by its victim
and, though he may seldom mention it, every
man is firmly convinced that he not only looks
but is at least ten years less than the register
would tell him. Though unconscious of the
change in himself he notes it with perhaps
some self-congratulation in his contemporaries.
It is only if he tests himself, for example by
timing himself for a mile’s walk, that a healthy
man of say 70 years has it borne in on him
that he is not what he was. The information
that he is old may be suddenly conveyed by
overhearing the chance remarks of others,
by catching a reflection of his bent back in a
mirror, by tardy recovery from illness, or the
advent of some disability, such as hypertrophy
of the prostate or dyspnoea on holiday exertion.
Perhaps the commonest warning is a feeling
of fatigue. Sir Andrew Clark regarded the
onset of old age as the period when a man
ceased to adjust himself to his environment;
but some persons never are able to do this,
and misfits are not necessarily old. Laurentius
divided old age beginning at 50 into the three
stages of “the green because it is accompanied
with prudence, full of experience, and fit to
gouerne common weales,” the second at 70<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
years is “very cold and drie,” and the last,
without a specified age incidence, is that of
decrepitude corresponding to the famous
description in the 12th chapter of Ecclesiastes.
A more modern and comforting division is
that of Lacassagne<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> of pre-senility, old age
beginning at 60 or sometimes 70 in men, and
in women 10 to 15 years earlier, advanced
old age, and lastly decrepitude. Nascher<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a>
speaks of a senile climacteric about the latter
part of the 7th or 8th decade—the transitional
period between old age and decrepitude—corresponding
to the changes at puberty and
at the menopause.</p>

<p><i>Precocious old age</i> due to the effects of disease,
especially syphilis and acute infections, and to
metabolic defects, which permanently damage
the cells of the body, has a special interest as
it supports Metchnikoff’s pathological view
that old age as ordinarily seen is a result of
toxic injury (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">vide</i> p. 82). Hastings Gilford<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a>
has specially investigated premature senility,
and under the title progeria has described
a remarkable condition of premature senility<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
combined with, or secondary to, infantilism.
This condition was independently described
in 1910 by Variot and Pironneau<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> as the senile
type of nanism. In such cases it would appear
reasonable to ascribe these two opposite conditions
to the same toxic or other factor, the
infantilism depending more on damage to the
ductless glands before development was complete,
and the senile changes to direct injury
of the cells in the body in general.</p>

<span class="subhead">FACTORS INFLUENCING LONGEVITY</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The determining factors of long life may be
broadly divided into those included under
heredity, environment, due functional activity,
and personal habits. It is impossible to separate
these factors into watertight compartments, for
a certain amount of overlapping between them
is unavoidable.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Heredity</span></h3>

<p>The influence of heredity has often been
insisted upon and is perhaps the most important
factor in longevity. Out of 824 persons
between 80 and 100 years of age analysed by
Humphry, 406, or 49·4 per cent, came of long-lived
families. Numerous striking examples of
such families are on record, but a few only
need be given. Roy<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> quotes the case of Dr.
Iverex, who died in 1700 at the age of 104,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
his father at 112, his mother 107, and his
grandfather 130 years, and gives four other
examples of three centenarians in the same
family. Another remarkable family group was
that of Joseph Retas who died at Tarbes at
the age of 118 in 1888, and was the son of a
man aged 111 years and had a brother aged
114 years. Two centenarian twin sisters were
recorded in a village near Athlone<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a>; centenarian
sisters and brothers are not so very exceptional.
Sir Hermann Weber<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> recorded two families,
in one of which the average age of ten children
was over 90 years and in the other of eight
children nearly 90 years.</p>

<p>A good stock may ensure long life in the
face of adverse environment, such as town life
and alcoholism; thus Dr. John Brownlee<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a>
showed statistically that while persons dying
at the age of 51 in the average environment
would have, had they lived in the country,
a mean life of seven years longer, this difference
was less at higher ages, and remarks that
a person who has the potentiality of living to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
the age of 80 years has a force of life which
is more or less independent of environment.
Sir George Savage<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a> often noted that of two
aged members of the same family one was
sober the other intemperate; and a good
many centenarians have taken alcohol in
quantities that would be too much for ordinary
people.</p>

<p>Heredity is not an all-powerful factor, for
an individual whose family history is not
remarkable for longevity may greatly prolong
his life by carefully correcting unfavourable
hereditary tendencies. Thus the late Sir Hermann
Weber, who lived to the age of 95
as the result of practising the maxims of his
<cite>Prolongation of Life</cite>, mentions that his mother
died of cardiac failure before she was 60 and
his father at 60 from cerebral haemorrhage,
and he gives other instances of the same happy
result of wise management. Not unfrequently
husband and wife both live to an advanced
age, no doubt often as the result of favourable
environment. A photograph of a married
couple both 101 years old appears as the
frontispiece of Sir George Humphry’s book
on <cite>Old Age</cite>, and must of course be accepted;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
but the same cannot be said of the frontispiece
to volume ii. of Sir John Sinclair’s <cite>Code of
Health and Longevity</cite> (1807), representing the
Hungarian husband and wife, aged respectively
172 and 164 years, who had been married
147 years.</p>

<p>It has been suggested that “cell-memory”
by providing experience as to the proper way
to behave at the different periods of life has
a bearing on the coming of old age; Samuel
Butler<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> argued that cells without hereditary
memory of past existence at, say, 75 years,
would become puzzled and so disordered as
to die. Parkes Weber<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> has modified this
view by assuming a failure of the wish to live
on the part of the nerve cells of the brain,
a want which might also be hereditary. The
possession by the cells of “the will to live”
would be an important factor in longevity
and should be obtained by individual effort
or in other words be an acquired character,
though the reverse conditions such as physical
mutilations,<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> often spoken of as acquired
characters, are known not to be inherited.</p>

<p>In different countries and in different<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
individuals the cells of the body may differ
in the rate at which they live; they have,
as Sir James Paget<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> said, a different “time-rate”;
in some the time-rate is rapid, for
example in the natives of hot climates where
maturity comes early and old age at a time
that seems very premature by our standard;
in others the body, sometimes the mind,
works slowly, is set at a more leisurely rate
and therefore takes longer to run its course.
In some persons this appears to be shown by
a slow pulse, a characteristic that may also
be hereditary.</p>

<p>Of the hereditary factors most concerned
in longevity the inherent vitality of the central
nervous system is the most essential; physiological
death in man and the higher animals
is probably due to failure of the cells of the
brain, which do not multiply after birth and
are less capable of rejuvenescence than those
of the other organs. The integrity of the
cardio-vascular system is also most important;
in Sir William Osler’s<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a> words much depends
“on the quality of arterial tissue (vital rubber)
which the individual has inherited.” According<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
to Sir Clifford Allbutt<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a> there are two modes
of hereditary transmission of arteriosclerosis,
the direct and the indirect; the direct which
he calls decrescent or primary, consisting in
an original frailty or toxic susceptibility which
like other peculiarities may run in families;
and the indirect or hyperpietic, a secondary
event due not to inherent taint in the arterial
walls but to metabolic changes causing high
arterial pressure; it is in such families with
hereditary high blood pressure that cerebral
haemorrhage occurs in one generation after
another about the same age (65–70). In
examining people the discovery of a blood pressure
low for their age often justifies, in
the absence of any pathological condition, the
suggestion that the family is long-lived. The
frequency of cardiac hypertrophy (43 per cent
of Councilman’s cases), even though it be a
pathological condition, shows that its reserve
power is good. Death among the aged very
commonly depends on some morbid change in
the cardio-vascular system; thus at the Royal
Hospital, Chelsea, Majors R. J. C. Thompson
and R. E. Todd<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a> found that among 169<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
deaths of pensioners with an average age of
77·2 years the largest number 64, or 38 per
cent, were due to this cause; lesions of the
respiratory system, pneumonia, and bronchopneumonia,
coming next with 41 deaths, or
24 per cent, malignant disease being responsible
for 22, or 13 per cent. The nervous and
circulatory systems are intimately correlated
with each other, disorder or disease of one,
particularly of the cardio-vascular system, exerting
an evil influence on the other. In a
negative manner weakness of the digestive
system may favour longevity by preventing
the excesses which vigorous individuals may
for a time at any rate indulge in with impunity;
but as a rule the digestion of the long-lived
is good.</p>

<p>The first-born is significantly handicapped,
as Karl Pearson<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a> has shown, and more subject
to tuberculosis, insanity, and criminality. But
out of 71 centenarians analysed by Sir George
Humphry 17, or 24 per cent, were firstlings,
and 24 per cent of 824 persons between 80
and 100 were first-born. It must be remembered
that first-born are more numerous
than any others, and some of the above were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
only children. The most frequent position
in the family among these 895 old people
analysed by Sir George Humphry was the
third.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Environment</span></h3>

<p>The influences included under the head of
environment are numerous, and this factor
cannot be entirely separated from that of
heredity, for environment may favour and
shape hereditary characteristics. The subject
of the harmony and the want of harmony
existing between man and his surroundings is
so vast that it is possible to touch on a few only
of these aspects.</p>

<p>The average length of life varies in different
countries; a temperate or moderately cold
climate is conducive to a slower development
of maturity and so to a longer life than tropical
regions. The Balkans, Greece, Scandinavia,
the Pyrenees, California, and small islands are
considered favourable to longevity. A high
elevation has been regarded as an important
factor, and the great age of the monks of
Mount Athos has been thus explained, though
other influences, such as simplicity of life, may
well play a part. Switzerland, however, does
not conform to the view that a high elevation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
confers long life on its inhabitants. From
observations around Dijon Noirot<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a> drew up a
scale showing that the elevation above the sea
and length of life rose together. National
habits have a bearing, and this may help to
explain the longevity of the Jews, who follow
the Mosaic laws of health, and why the French
appear to be more long-lived than the Germans.
The long-continued persecution and hard life
that the Jews have undergone has led to the
survival of the fittest and a hereditary factor.
The former simplicity of the Russian peasants
would also provide a reason for their reputed
longevity (one centenarian in every thousand).
In Ireland, though much depleted by migration
of young adults, the absolute number of
centenarians is very high; in 1888 there were
208 such deaths, or 43 per million living; in
the ten years 1911–20 inclusive there were
1030 centenarian deaths, or about 23 per
million living; and the Registrar-General,
Sir William J. Thompson, kindly informs me
that in 1921 there were 314 centenarians
living in a population of 4,496,000, or about
70 per million of the population. It seems
probable that this is the outcome of a simple
life. In England and Wales the number of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
centenarians is both relatively and absolutely
less; in 1887 there were said to be about 2
and the 1911 census returns showed 3·6 living
centenarians per million of the population;
the return of the 1921 census is not yet available.
In the ten completed years 1910–19 there were
691 centenarian deaths, or an average of 69
annually among a population averaging about
35 millions—about two per million living.
In California there are, according to Laurent,<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a>
300 centenarians in a population of three
millions, or 100 per million, the extremely
favourable climatic conditions accounting for
this high ratio. In the same country there is
a difference, much to the advantage of the rural
inhabitants, between the prospect of longevity
in the towns and in the sparsely populated
districts. From their open-air life agricultural
labourers provide the largest percentage of
long lives.</p>

<p><i>Improved Conditions of Life.</i>—There is good
evidence that the average expectation of life
has improved in this country during the period
that increasing attention has been paid to
sanitation. This is shown by the tables of
the Registrar-General. For most of the following
information I am indebted to Dr. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>T. H. C.
Stevenson of the General Register Office,
Somerset House. In 1838–54 the expectation
of males at birth in England and Wales was
39·91 years, in 1901–10 the male and female
expectations at birth were 48·53 and 52·38
years respectively, and the latest available expectations
at birth (English Life, Table No. 8,
Supplement to the Seventy-fifth Annual Report
of the Registrar-General, Cd. 7512) are
51·6 for males and 55·35 years for females.
But the expectation is probably considerably
more now, as the death rates have fallen
appreciably since 1910–12. The Prussian
male expectation of life at birth has increased
from 35·38 years in 1867–77 to 46·43 in
1906–10;<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a> and the Swedish<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a> expectation of
life at birth from 39·5 years in males and 43·6
years in females in 1816–40 to 54·5 and 57
years respectively in 1901–10. In North
America<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a> there has been a fall in the death rate
in every age group in 1920 as compared with
1910.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
The increased expectation of life has been
especially prominent in early and adult life.
Examination of the Registrar-General’s census
returns from 1851 to 1911 show that although
there were more persons per million living
between the ages of 55 and 75 there were less
above the age of 75 at the end than at the
beginning of this 60-years’ period. It has
been suggested that the increased survival in
the earlier period of old age is due to the
saving of life in infancy and that, as these lives
are not prolonged above the age of 75 or so,
the diminished proportion of persons living
to become octogenarians is explained (H.
Weber).</p>

<p><i>The influence of past diseases</i> is perhaps most
conveniently considered in connexion with
environment. As infection must necessarily
impair the vitality of the cells of the body,
either temporarily or permanently, it would be
natural to expect that those who live to a
great age would show a remarkably clean bill
of health. This is often true. But it is at
first sight rather disconcerting to find that
nearly half of the 824 persons between 80 and
100 years of age analysed by Sir George
Humphry had had severe illnesses at one time
or another; many of these, however, were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
acute infections. It is noticeable that 85 per
cent were free from rheumatism in the hands
(selected as a convenient test in his collective
investigation), which in the light of present
opinion that arthritis is the result of a focal
infection would appear to show that these old
people are remarkably free from chronic disease.
Long-continued infection or intoxication would
be a far more potent factor than a transient illness
in producing permanent change in the cells.
A short acute infection would cause changes
in the cells which might, like those of fatigue,
be temporary and recoverable. Saundby’s<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a>
dictum may be accepted as fairly accurate,
exception being made for peripheral mutilations,
namely, that those only can expect to
live to extreme old age who at the age of 60
possess bodies free from disease. But critical
examination would no doubt show that focal
infections become increasingly frequent as the
years go on; this is particularly true as regards
oral sepsis; after two years’ experience of 500
pensioners at the Royal Hospital, Chelsea,
Thompson and Todd have never seen a tooth
in a healthy condition there. It is noteworthy
that dental disease seems to have become
common with the advent of civilization, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
judged by examination of ancient skulls, though
the loss of teeth is an accompaniment of the
bony changes in old age, and very old people
seldom have more than a few teeth left. On
the other hand, an acute illness is often the
apparent starting-point of old age; there may
be a long and imperfect convalescence due to
persistence of infection, or deterioration may be
due to auto- or hetero-suggestion (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">vide</i> p. 48).</p>

<p>The influence of syphilis, whether congenital
or acquired, is one of the most important in
the prevention of healthy longevity; it not
only directly disables and kills, especially in
infancy and in the fifth decade, but it damages
the vitality of the cells thus producing degeneration
and premature senility, and favours
secondary infections.</p>

<p>It is clear that for the preservation of
health detection of disease in the earliest stage
is all-important, and that this can be attained
by periodic examination by a medical man;
but obvious though this may be, the average
man waits to call in a doctor until he knows
that he is ill. Timely advice as to methods
of life, food and drink, occupation, or environment
would often prevent disease and premature
death. In 1913 the Life Extension
Institute was founded in New York for such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
periodic examination and report, and the Life
Assurance Companies, finding that persons so
examined showed, at any rate for some years,
a death rate lower than that anticipated, gave it
financial support.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Functional Activity</span></h3>

<p>As is well known, disuse leads to atrophy,
and biologically conditions rendering an animal’s
supply of food extremely easy and safe are
followed by atrophy of the parts no longer
necessary in a state which may thus come to
border on parasitism; in an extreme degree this
result is shown in barnacles (degenerated
crustaceans) and ascidians (degenerated vertebrates).
In man the cessation of an active life
on retirement to the country, described by
Samuel Johnson as “a kind of mental imprisonment,”
or the sudden acquisition of wealth,
often exerts a most evil influence; for if the
whole body is no longer kept in a condition
of functional activity, those parts allowed to
remain relatively idle begin to degenerate and
atrophy; loss of function means a diminished
blood supply and nutrition, and so degenerative
atrophy. According to Laurentius “nothing
hastens old age more than idleness.” James<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
Easton,<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a> who collected 1712 records of centenarians,
many of them open to criticism,
endorses Hufeland’s dictum that no idler has
ever attained to a remarkably great age; and
Sir Thomas Browne’s<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a> quaint injunction “Dull
not away thy days in sloathful supinity and
the tediousness of doing nothing” is old but
true wisdom.</p>

<p>The axiom that disuse leads to atrophy
applies perhaps even more to mental activity,
for resting and rusting of the brain slow the
pace of the whole body, whereas an alert
mind can exist in an infirm body. There is
no doubt that occupation with a strong desire
to live for the accomplishment of a definite
purpose exerts a most beneficial influence, and
there have not been wanting some, such as
Karl Marx, who have preached that old age
is in great part a matter of will. Speaking
of the circle in which Madame du Deffand
moved Lytton Strachey<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a> says “They refused
to grow old; they almost refused to die.
Time himself seems to have joined their circle,
to have been infected with their politeness,
and to have absolved them, to the furthest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
possible point from the operation of his laws.
Voltaire, d’Argental, Moncrif, Hénault,
Madame d’Egmont, Madame du Deffand
herself all lived to be well over eighty, with
the full zest of their activities unimpaired.”
Want of this joy in life necessarily engenders
carelessness and neglect of personal hygiene, and
loss of the power to react to the environment.
As the years advance and the younger generation
come up, the suggestion that “his day
is done,” that he has had his innings, and that
it is time for him to step aside, is made to the
senior not only by his family and his juniors—hetero-suggestion—but
by himself, and he
may then, after the modern fashion, get into
the habit of repeating mentally “I am getting
older and older every day.” A slight illness
or incapacity may be magnified into a conviction
that the end is near, and as a result
of the loss of self-reliance a state of increasing
invalidism is established and becomes progressive
without any other cause. Just as a
fall, an exacerbation of rheumatic pain, a slight
operation or indisposition, necessitating rest in
bed for a short time, may be followed by a
functional loss of power in the lower extremities,
so a more general suggestion of failing powers
may lead to mental deterioration. Thus too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
often a man’s last occupation is to shorten
his existence and make it miserable. Finot,<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a>
who rather optimistically believes that man
should be able to live 150 years, regards this
poisonous auto-suggestion as one of the factors
that prevent such an achievement. Observation
of contemporaries suffering from premature
senile changes, due to pathological factors,
may no doubt stimulate this destructive form
of auto-suggestion. There is therefore a basis
for the idea<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a> attributed to the late Lord
Rhondda that old age was a transferable
disease, and for his avoidance, as far as possible,
of the society of the aged on account of the
risk of contagion. Association with the young
keeps one more or less of the same age, very
probably by suggestion to the unconscious, or
in Oliver Wendell Holmes’s words “While
we’ve youth in our hearts we can never grow
old.” From experience at the Royal Hospital,
Chelsea, where there are 500 pensioners,
Thompson and Todd<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a> are convinced of the
powerful factor of lowered mentality due to
loss of self-reliance, self-respect, and the instinct
of self-preservation in inducing premature<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
senility, and have been most successful in
counteracting this by antidotal suggestion conveyed
by cheerful chaff and by the avoidance
of sympathetic condolence.</p>

<p>In addition to the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">joie de vivre</i> a happy
disposition that thinketh no evil, has no
jealous suspicions, and is free from the tendency
to worry has an important influence in keeping
the mind and body young. The power of
detachment from work and anxieties, as if the
mind were fitted with thought-tight compartments,
is a valuable asset in maintaining
vitality unimpaired; this was a trait in Gladstone
and Kitchener.</p>

<p>Professional men who retain their offices
as in the Church, the Civil Government, the
Bar, tend to live longer than business men who
retire to leisured ease after a strenuous struggle.
B. Yeo’s<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a> analysis of 42 Bishops and Deans,
49 Judges, and 188 Peers, showed that in
all three classes the average duration of life
was practically the same, namely, 72 years.
Among churchmen mention may be made of
Cardinal de Salis (110), Gregory IX. (100),
Abbé Maignon (100), Martin Routh (100),
for 63 years President of Magdalen College,
Oxford, thus surpassing the more modern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
instance of Edward Atkinson, aged 96 years,
for 59 of which he was Master of Clare, but
not that of Laurence Chaderton (1536–1640)
who, after being Master of Christ’s College,
Cambridge, with great success for 38 years,
survived for 18 years and became a centenarian.
There are some remarkable examples of artists
retaining an active life to a very advanced
age, such as Titian, Giovanni Bellini, Michael
Angelo, Sidney Cooper. Politics often keep
men busy and active to an advanced age, and
the names of Palmerston, Brougham, Lyndhurst,
the octogenarian premiers Gladstone and
Clemenceau, Strathcona, Sir Charles Tupper
naturally come to one’s mind. In the legal
profession Chief Justices and Judges can
retain their seats and so keep up their vigour
long past what is regarded in some walks of
life as the retiring age. Sir Edward Coke
(82), Lord Mansfield (89), Lord Brampton
(90), Lord St. Leonards (93), and Lord
Halsbury (97), are examples in point. Within
recent years there have been two octogenarian
Lord Mayors of London, Sir Thomas Crosby
(in 1911), and Sir John James Baddeley
(1921); the first created a record by being
the first medical man to hold this office, and
Sir John Baddeley celebrated his year of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
Mayoralty by bringing out a beautiful historical
account of Cripplegate.</p>

<p>From the inevitable exposure to infection
and worry the medical fraternity is generally
considered to rank low in the professions as
regards longevity, but it is easy to point to
exceptions especially among those whose mental
vigour made them prominent in their own
and in one instance for all time. Hippocrates
is variously stated to have died at the ages
of 85, 90, 104, or 106 years with the words
“I leave behind me two great physicians,
temperance and frugality.”<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a> I have references
to 43 medical centenarians for 18 of which,
including the record of W. G. Meade, physician
at Tunbridge Wells and buried at Ware,
Herts, in November 1652, aged 148¾ years,
I am indebted to my friend Mr. R. R. James.
The only one that I knew personally was
Sir Henry Pitman, for 31 years (1858–89)
and until his 82nd year Registrar of the Royal
College of Physicians of London. Among the
others Dr. de Bossy of Paris may be mentioned
as the son of a centenarian. From analysis
of 2113 eminent medical men Drinkwater<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
found that the average age was 67 years,
or considerably above the average age of the
male population over 21 years, which was
estimated at 59 years, and that 627 or nearly
a third of them all were between 71 and 80
years of age.</p>

<p>But the examples given of mental activity
late in life, and they could easily be multiplied,<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a>
are exceptions to the rule that the majority
of men begin to fail in their work between
60 and 70. This no doubt is because most
septuagenarians suffer in greater or less degree
from pathological old age. In the case of the
healthy vigorous man enforced retirement at
the age of 65 or 70 is not to the advantage
of either the retiring victim or the community,
for it restricts his opportunities for production
and useful activities guided by ripe experience.
To quote examples of epoch-making work
done by men long past the age when the
majority have lost originality, initiative, and
elasticity of mind: Galileo, Newton, Charles
Darwin, Sophocles, Voltaire, Molière, Goethe,
Michael Angelo, and Titian, made original and
lasting contributions to science, literature, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
art long after fifty. Morgagni’s famous <cite xml:lang="la" lang="la">De
Sedibus et Causis Morborum</cite>, brought out when
he was 80, and the Commentaries of W.
Heberden (aged 91), published posthumously,
represent the accumulation of many years and
so cannot be fairly quoted as examples of
ability persisting into late life. Rules and
regulations must, however, be based on what
is best for the majority and hence, though
the exceptions are prominent and regrettable,
the age limit of 65 to 70 must at present be
accepted as generally advisable for otherwise
permanent appointments.</p>

<p>Although functional activity maintains the
tissues in a state of health, it is not an infallible
panacea for the prolongation of life; in the
first place the danger of overwork and excessive
fatigue must be borne in mind. While the
attractive suggestion that excessive functional
activity leading to extreme hypertrophy may
exhaust the vitality of the tissues and lead to
atrophy, may not be borne out by the examples
quoted in its favour, such as the occupational
neuroses and atrophy of the upper arm muscles
in hammermen and file-cutters, there is some
reason to retain a belief that this sequence of
events may occur, for example in dilatation of
the extremely hypertrophied hearts seen in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
long-continued high blood pressure, renal
disease, and valvular lesions;<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a> but even here
the possibility of other degenerative changes,
due to toxaemia, must be borne in mind.
Further, functional activity while keeping the
cells of the body in a healthy state depends
on their structural integrity, and this in its
turn is the outcome of the modifications due
to environment, and possibly of the inborn
lease of vitality. So that although an active
life may within limits prolong life, there are
many instances in which, from extrinsic pathological
influences or inherent inadequacy, it
fails to do so, and a man becomes unequal
to the demands of his position.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Personal Habits</span></h3>

<p>All experience, medical and lay, such as
is embodied in Cornaro’s oft-quoted memoirs,
Leonardus Lessius’s <cite>Hygiasticon or the right
course of preserving life and health until extreme
old age</cite> (1613), George Cheyne’s <cite>Essay
of Health and Long Life</cite> (1724), Metchnikoff’s
orthobiosis, and the Arabian proverb of
the ninth century, quoted by Lacassagne,<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
that “the greatest dangers for an old man
are a good cook and a young wife,” is in
agreement as to the immense importance of
strict moderation in indulging the appetites
for the prolongation of life. The life histories
of centenarians show that they have usually
been small eaters, especially of meat. This
is generally explained in terms of minimizing
toxaemia, and it has been said that “man does
not die, he kills himself” (Montaigne) and
more graphically, if coarsely, that “he digs
his grave with his teeth.” In some lower
forms of life, such as the planarians (Child),
partial starvation and the resulting reduction
lead to rejuvenescence and so to the inhibition
of the onset of senescence; hibernation has
somewhat the same effect, though perhaps
this might be partly explained as merely
starvation during prolonged sleep. The question
has often been raised whether partial
starvation in man has any such positive influence,
and unprofessional “cures” on these
economical lines have not been unfashionable.
It might indeed be argued that the Allen
treatment of diabetes, in which starvation is
followed by increased carbohydrate tolerance,
depends on a certain degree of rejuvenescence.
Cures consisting in purgation may act by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
partial starvation as well as by obviating
toxaemia. After a period of starvation a
normal person may become heavier than before,
and his general health be improved. But in
the present state of our knowledge and in the
light of the dangers of starvation the further
investigation in man of this problem is one
that demands serious hesitation.</p>

<p>As to the bad influence of alcohol on
longevity there can be no reasonable doubt.
Alcohol is a protoplasmic poison causing
degenerative changes in the cells and reducing
the resistance to infection. A collective investigation
undertaken by Sir Isambard Owen<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a>
showed that there were very few hard drinkers
among the long-lived, and Sir George Humphry
concluded that the characteristics of the aged
included temperance; among 46 centenarians
one, and among 73 men over 90 one confessed
to taking too much occasionally, and out of
298 men between 80 and 90 years of age 45,
or 15 per cent, were classified as taking much
alcohol. That such exceptions occur is explicable
by great inherent vitality. It has been
said that “wine is the milk of old people,”
but from his experience of the hygiene of the
elderly Sir Hermann Weber was not in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
sympathy with this view, and he pointed out
the weakness of the popular idea that the
moderate enjoyment of alcohol was harmless;
for so-called moderate drinking is in reality often
immoderate indulgence for the individual, and
most of us must have recognized from observation
that long-continued though moderate use
of alcohol is followed by premature deterioration.
The proverb <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">vinum lac veneris</i> and the tendency
that alcohol has to lead to incontinence and
so to venereal infection may be borne in mind
in considering its influence on longevity. As
a medicine alcohol has its occasional use, and
though it may be a food it is an expensive one.</p>

<p>Smoking among centenarians was specially
investigated by Sir George Humphry, who
found that among 19 male centenarians 8
smoked much, one a little, and 10 not at all;
while out of 30 female centenarians 4 smoked
much, 2 moderately or little, and 24 not at
all. There is no doubt that with advancing
years there is commonly a relative loss of
tolerance for tobacco, so that unpleasant
symptoms ranging from cardiac extra-systoles,
through abdominal pain, to tobacco angina,
may dictate discontinuance of the habit. But
a large number of old people have smoked in
earlier life though subsequently non-smokers.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
Personal tolerance to tobacco shows great
variations, and there is no doubt that well-marked
symptoms may be caused by tobacco.
But that moderate smoking diminishes the
chance of longevity has certainly not been
proved. Much discussion has taken place as
to the relation between smoking and arteriosclerosis;
it is true that in animals nicotine
in considerably larger doses than can be
absorbed by smokers, damages the arteries,
and Huchard and Lazarus were convinced
that it caused arteriosclerosis. Sir Clifford
Allbutt,<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a> after quoting the various opinions,
points out that if tobacco be a cause of arterial
disease, it acts very slowly, for at 45 years of
age, after a quarter of a century’s exposure,
the smoker’s arteries are not distinguishable
from those of the abstainer’s; and he mentions
the arteriosclerosis of the ancient Egyptians
and of women as incidents detracting from any
argument that tobacco is an important cause
of arterial disease.</p>

<p>A large proportion of the centenarians and
persons over 80 years of age collected by Sir
George Humphry obeyed the adage early to
rise and early to bed, and I well remember<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
that he used to lay stress on the factor of
getting up directly one woke and so denying
the flesh the luxury of further sleep. Whether
going to bed early and getting up early is more
than an index of a life otherwise spent in
accordance with the late Sir Andrew Clark’s
“laws of physiological righteousness” may be
questioned.</p>

<p><i>Bodily Conformation.</i>—Long-lived people are
usually spare, obesity being rare, and, allowing
for some shortening due to age, of a good
average height (Humphry). It is interesting
in this connexion to quote the conclusions
arrived at by Robertson and Ray<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a> from comparison
of groups of long-lived and short-lived
white mice in similar conditions. The long-lived
were relatively stable, highly resistant to
external disturbing factors, displaying subnormal
variability and a more or less well-marked,
but not invariable, tendency to early
overgrowth and relative paucity of tissue
accretion in late life; while the short-lived
animals showed exactly the opposite features
with a tendency to rapid increase of tissue in
late life.</p>

<p>The importance of a healthy life with
plenty of fresh air, sunshine, exercise, proper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
diet, and absence of worry hardly needs
insistence. Leonard Williams<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a> has epigrammatically
summed up the hygiene of old age
as “Fresh air, meagre fare, freedom from
care.”</p>

ATROPHY: LIMITED VITALITY
OF CELLS—INFLUENCE OF THE
ENDOCRINE GLANDS—METCHNIKOFF’S
PATHOLOGICAL EXPLANATION</span>

<span class="subhead">SENESCENCE AND CARCINOMA</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The causation of old age is so complex that it
is not possible to argue with any conviction
that any one of the following explanations
exclusively solves the problem satisfactorily.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Limited Vitality of the Cells</span></h3>

<p>To explain the atrophic processes normal
to old age it has naturally been assumed that
the constituent cells are endowed with a
certain store of vitality for themselves and their
descendants, and that as this becomes exhausted
the process of involution begins. This conception
of an inherent limit of life is probable
from the analogy of the existing limit of height
and size, though in certain plants and trees<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
growth in size and length of days do not
show a natural limitation. The process of
ageing of the cells is thus regarded as just as
much part of their development or life cycle as
are their earlier and progressive stages. The
exception is that the reproductive cell when it
meets with its complement—the ovum with
the spermatozoon—and as it were with new
blood, starts a fresh lease of life, and so in Sir
Edward Sharpey-Schafer’s<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a> words “we can
only be immortal through our descendants.”
That there is a more or less definite cycle
during which the cells multiply and after which
they cease to do so receives support from the
anatomical and physiological changes in old
age; thus the ovary undergoes fibrotic atrophy
and ceases to be actively functional after the
menopause. The atrophy or hypoplasia of the
organs is due to diminution of the proliferation
of the constituent cells. This is well
shown in the lymphatic glands and spleen
which are so active in youth and atrophied in
advanced life. Salimbeni and Gery<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a> point
out that the hypoplasia in the woman aged
93 whom they minutely examined was most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
prominent in the lymphatic tissues and the
bone marrow which have to supply the cells
most constantly needed. Even in the lowest
forms of life senescence and death would occur
in the absence of the rejuvenescence associated
with reproduction. In the complex congeries
of cells making up the higher animals and
man this rejuvenescence does not accompany
reproduction, and the vitality of the constituent
cells diminishes until eventually atrophy and
death supervene.</p>

<p>Many of the vital phenomena of cells may,
as Martin Fischer,<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a> Lumière,<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a> and others point
out, be interpreted in terms of the behaviour
of simple hydrophilic colloids. Bechhold<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a>
has shown that, like a simple colloidal jelly,
the cells of the human body, which are colloidal
masses, lose their affinity for water progressively
with age and become less elastic; the water
content of the fetus being 94 per cent, as
compared with 70 per cent at birth and 58
per cent in adult life, thus recalling the old
idea of the dryness of elderly bodies. According
to Marinesco<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a> dehydration of the colloids<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
in the cells is an inherent progressive change
in evolution and leads to senescence and
death. It has also been thought that as the
result of differentiation and metabolism the
cell protoplasm may become overladen with
products inimical to its vitality, which it cannot,
as can the protozoa, utilize for rejuvenation,
and which hinder metabolism. The micellae,
or aggregations of albumin constituting the
colloids of the cells, alter in structure and
become more stable until the colloid state
disappears and the cell accordingly dies (Lumière,
Danysz). Such changes must obviously
be greatly influenced, as H. Campbell<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a> and
others have insisted, by their environment;
the individual cells are in some degree of
material continuity by “protoplasmic bridges”
which probably serve not only for nutritional
purposes but also for the transmission of
physiological impulses. It also appears that
the life cycle of the cell is determined not so
much by time as by the interaction of the
tissues and the plasma. By cultivating connective
tissue in the plasma of chickens of
different ages Carrel<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a> showed that its growth
was more abundant in the plasma of younger<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
chickens than in that of older ones. Working
on these lines Loeb and Northrop<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a> concluded
that the duration of life was determined either
by a substance leading to old age or by the
destruction of a substance which normally
prevents old age and natural death. More
recently Carrel and Ebeling<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a> found that in
these cultures of connective tissue the rate of
multiplication of fibroblasts and the duration
of life <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">in vitro</i> varied in inverse ratio to the age
of the animal from which the plasma was taken,
and that this depended on the presence of an
inhibitory body in the plasma of older animals.
These experiments recall the practice centuries
old of transfusion of young persons’ blood into
the old which, however, led to disastrous
results on account of a technique now known
to be dangerous. Whether with modern
methods success will be obtained remains to
be proved, but probably repeated transfusions
would be required. But to return to the
subject: Carrel, Champy, and Grandcourt
have shown that, with frequent washings to
remove waste products, tissue cells can be
cultivated indefinitely for years <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">in vitro</i>, and in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
themselves have an unlimited capacity for
multiplication; it therefore appears that the
ageing of cells in the living organism is determined
by extrinsic factors in the plasma rather
than by any inherent limitation in the cells. In
the ordinary conditions of life senescence of the
cells might be regarded as the result of increasing
differentiation and, possibly from accumulation
of material which cannot be utilized for
rejuvenation, of diminished metabolic activity.
In the physiological life of gland cells, for
example, the salivary glands and pancreas,
granules are manufactured and discharged, but
the hypothetical material which collects in
elderly cells, of which pigment may possibly
be an example or the visible sign, remains in
these cells and hampers their functional activity.
As atrophy of the functional cells and increase
of connective tissue are regarded as characteristic
of senescence, and a high proportion of cells as
characteristic of embryonic life, Robertson and
Ray<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a> suggest that the potential longevity of
any individual is determined by the relative
velocities of anabolism in the cells on the one
hand, and in the fibrous tissue on the other
hand. A low rate of cellular anabolism increases
the growth of the cells and delays the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
increase of fibrous tissue; this they were able
to effect by feeding white mice with tethelin.
The relations of the functionally active cells
and the connective tissues have also been
investigated by Nathan<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a> and his collaborators,
who bring forward experimental evidence in
favour of the modified view that while dense
connective tissue inhibits cellular proliferation,
young loose connective tissue favours the
multiplication of cells in proportion as it
approaches the structure of the embryonic
mesenchyma. Drew’s<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">92</a> observations on the
culture of tissues and tumours show that the
stroma acts like embryonic tissue in favouring
growth.</p>

<p>To sum up: the cells of the complex
organism depend for their duration of life
not so much on an inborn store of vitality
as on metabolic changes in the colloids which
in their turn are modified or controlled by
extrinsic factors of various kinds.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Relation of the Endocrine Glands
to Senescence</span></h3>

<p>As the metabolic activities of the cells of
the body generally are markedly influenced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
by the secretions of the ductless glands, the
relations between these endocrine glands and
senescence demand some discussion.</p>

<p>The process of reproduction leads to rejuvenescence
in the protozoa, and it might
therefore be imagined that in the higher
animals continued activity of the sexual glands
would similarly exert a rejuvenating influence
on the remaining cells of the body. But the
process of specialization has gone so far in
the cells of the higher animals that the highly
differentiated cells, especially of the nervous
system, cannot fairly be compared with the
constituent molecules of a unicellular organism.
As sexual activity is the biological reason for
existence and as in vigorous men sexual power
may last long beyond the usual period, man
being regarded as old as his sexual glands,
it has been widely imagined that the functional
activity of the sex glands is in some way a
cause, rather than a manifestation, of the preservation
of bodily vigour, and conversely
that failure and atrophy of the sexual glands
cause old age and senility. There is an
attraction, though not without the danger of
fallacies, in interpreting the words of older
writers as prophetic anticipations of quite
modern knowledge. But with this caution in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
mind there is some ground for crediting
Hufeland<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a> with some idea of the internal
secretion of the sexual glands: as long ago
as the end of the eighteenth century he wrote
“the organs of generation have the power of
secreting the finest and most spiritual parts
of our nourishment; but at the same time
they are so organised that these perfected and
ennobled juices can again return and be received
into the blood. Like the brain, therefore,
they belong to those important organs which
serve for bringing to perfection and ennobling
our organic matter and power, and even ourselves.”</p>

<p>Since 1889 when Brown-Séquard, at the
age of 72 (6 years before his death) put forward
the idea that rejuvenation could be brought
about by the hypodermic injection of testicular
emulsion, the view that old age and senile
changes are due to failure of the glands of
internal secretion has become popular. The
thyroid (V. Horsley, Léopold-Lévi), the testis
and ovary, or most or all of the glands (pluriglandular
insufficiency) have been incriminated;
Lorand,<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">94</a> indeed, regards old age as a disease
caused by degeneration of not one but several<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
of the endocrine glands, Biedl<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">95</a> expresses much
the same view in referring old age to a disturbance
of the endocrine balance, and Berman<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">96</a>
in a recent semi-popular book states that old
age is an exhaustion permanent and irreparable
of all the glands of internal secretion; like
Lorand he ascribes considerable importance to
failure of the internal secretions of the sexual
glands. It is highly desirable to arrive at
some conclusion as to the relation between
changes in the glands of internal secretion
and senescence, for in medical practice this
conception of cause and effect has been acted
upon; various glandular extracts have been
employed to counteract and delay the disabilities
that may accompany advancing years
and, though not so freely, operations, viz.,
ligature of the vas deferens and implantation
of testicular grafts, have been carried out.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Lydston<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">97</a> implanted testes from boys recently dead into
men with atrophied or destroyed testes and reported
improvement. Stanley and Kelker<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">98</a> implanted 11 cases<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
with testicular grafts obtained from executed criminals,
and 5 cases with the testes of rams, obtaining improved
general condition, though not claiming that life was prolonged.
Stanley<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">99</a> injected by means of a large syringe
strips of testes of rams, goats, or bears under the skin of
the abdomen of more than 300 prisoners, and stated that
conditions of neurasthenia and senility were relieved.</p></blockquote>

<p>The stimulating effect of thyroid secretion
on growth and metabolism, shown both experimentally
and clinically in the therapeutic
triumphs of thyroid treatment in myxoedema
and hypothyroidism, seems to justify the view
that failure of thyroid function plays an important
part in reducing the capacity for multiplication
and regeneration of cells. Between
the manifestations of hypothyroidism and those
of old age there are undoubtedly striking resemblances,
such as the dry skin, the loss of
hair, the diminished mental and bodily energy,
and the increased amount of interstitial fibrous
tissue. In some respects myxoedema and
cretinism imitate the senile state; myxoedema
has indeed been described as more than a
simulation and as the best example of secondary
senilism (Hastings Gilford<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">100</a>); but this is a
very different condition from healthy old age<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
which does not present the picture of complete
loss of thyroid function; old age therefore
cannot be regarded as due to athyroidism.
Usually atrophy of the thyroid accompanies
and corresponds to that of the senescent body
as a whole. No doubt pathological changes
may occur in the thyroid, especially in women,
during advancing years, and it is in such
instances that thyroid feeding produces so
much improvement that it has revived in our
day the hope of an elixir of life and perpetual
youth. It is not improbable that the administration
of thyroid gland extract may, by preventing
high blood pressure, delay or obviate
the onset of arteriosclerosis, and so stave off
senility due to this cause, but this is pathological
old age and not the physiological
involution.</p>

<p>In addition to the seminal tubules and ova,
which provide their external secretion, the
testes and ovaries contain the interstitial cells
described by Bouin and Ancel<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">101</a> or, in Steinach’s
phrase, “the puberty gland”; the germ cells
and the interstitial cells differ from each other
in structure, function, and reaction to external
influences; thus the germ cells though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
dominant are more susceptible to damage, for
example by ligature of the vas deferens, <i>x</i>-rays,
alcoholism, or pressure, as in the case of a
cryptorchid. It is stated that when the seminal
tubules are active and prominent the interstitial
cells are scanty, and conversely that when the
seminal tubules atrophy the interstitial cells
multiply; Lipschülz, Ottow, Wagner, and
Bormann<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">102</a> showed that hypertrophy of the
interstitial cells as observed in various experimental
conditions depends on local factors in
the testes and has nothing to do with their
internal secretion in relation to the body as
a whole. After ligature of the vas deferens
in animals there are, according to Steinach,
Kuntz,<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">103</a> and others, two stages (1) the seminal
tubules atrophy while the interstitial cells
multiply, and (2) after some time the seminal
tubules regenerate while a certain amount of increase
in the interstitial cells persists. Nathan<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">104</a>
ascribes the regeneration of the seminal tubes
to the influence of the interstitial cells, which
he considers act like young connective tissue
by favouring growth. The interstitial cells of
Leydig in the testis and the interstitial or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
lutein cells of the ovary are generally regarded
as responsible by their lipoid internal secretion
or hormone for the secondary sex characteristics
(Bouin and Ancel, K. Sand<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">105</a>), though
Blair Bell<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">106</a> and Sternberg<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">107</a> deny this. Sir
Frederick Mott,<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">108</a> who has extensively investigated
the interstitial cells, especially in
connexion with dementia praecox and other
forms of mental degeneration, concludes that
in fetal life they act as sex determinants, and
that later in life they are responsible for the
sexual appetite. It has been argued that
atrophy of the interstitial cells is the cause of
senescence. Against this view is Sir Frederick
Mott’s observation that after birth the interstitial
cells undergo progressive atrophy and disappear,
that they reappear and are in a state
of functional activity at puberty (a sequence
of events described by Aron<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">109</a> as two different
interstitial glands), and that they are present
in extreme old age; Retterer<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">110</a> also described
their presence in the testes of men over 70
years of age. So far it might be concluded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
that changes in old age, such as diminution
in number and pigmentation, shown by the
interstitial cells, are not the cause but an
accompaniment of senescence.</p>

<p>Kenneth Walker’s<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">111</a> observation that the
interstitial cells of the testis show a gradual
diminution in number from the age of about
30 years, might be quoted in favour of the
contention that atrophy of these cells plays
a part in the production of senescence. In
addition there are the dramatic experiments
on rats carried out by Eugen Steinach,<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">112</a> who
was formerly Professor of Physiology in the
German University of Prague and since 1912
has been Director of the Physiological Section
of the Experimental Biological Institute at
Vienna. He found that in apathetic senile
rats with degenerative changes in the thyroid,
pituitary, and interstitial cells ligature or
section of one vas deferens causes atrophy of
the seminal tubes and active growth of the
interstitial cells; the hormone thus provided
stimulates the thyroid, pituitary, and brain,
and the rat is rejuvenated, the sexual instincts
and emotions become active, and the rat may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
have offspring; when relapse into senility
occurs, a repetition of the operation on the
other side brings about a further rejuvenation;
and later the same result is effected by grafting
the testes of a young rat. In this way life
is definitely prolonged. This procedure has
been advocated in man with some success by
Steinach; Lichtenstern of Vienna, who has
done 36 such operations and 21 implantations
on account of senile changes, has not encountered
any bad results, but admits that he has not
been uniformly successful, and that the number
of cases is not sufficient to justify a final conclusion.
From observation in Vienna Benjamin<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">113</a>
estimated that the operation was followed by
no results at all in from 10 to 20 per cent of
the cases. Obviously a considerable time must
elapse before any decision as to prolongation
of life can thus be assured.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In the autumn of 1921 a man aged 70 was advertised
to speak at the Albert Hall on “How I was made 20
years younger by the Method of Dr. Steinach of Vienna,”
but he died on the morning of the day from pneumonia
(Benjamin<a href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">113</a>), the necropsy not revealing, so it is said,
any trace of an operation; the hypertrophy of the interstitial
cells, however, may have been induced by the
exposure of the testes to <i>x</i>-rays.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
Steinach’s observations naturally aroused
great interest and have been repeated with discordant
results by a number of investigators:
Simmonds<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">114</a> and Tiedje<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">115</a> have failed to confirm
the occurrence of the changes in the testes after
vasectomy; and Romeis<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">116</a> and Marinesco<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">117</a>
have not obtained the striking clinical results
described by Steinach. Levy Lenz and
Schmidt,<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">118</a> however, report rejuvenation in 23
out of 24 cases of vasectomy, and Voronoff
encouraging results from implantation of chimpanzee’s
testes into man. But Marinesco
compares Steinach’s published results with
those of Brown-Séquard.</p>

<p>It may be added that the operation of ligature
of the vas deferens which was performed
some 25 years ago, before prostatectomy became
established, in order to cause atrophy of
enlarged prostate, was not noticed to be followed
by rejuvenescence. Mr. C. Mansell-Moullin,
who published<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">119</a> a series of 14 such cases, has
kindly informed me that his patients did not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
show any evidence of such a change. Romeis
has also raised this objection to Steinach’s
results which it has been thought might be
explained by suggestion (Freudenberg)—a view
hardly tenable in the light of the remarkable
results described in animal experiments.</p>

<p>The internal secretion of the ovary has never
been isolated, and the evidence of its existence
rests on the results of removal. Castration in
men and in women does not bring on the
phenomena of old age, though this operation
is followed by well-marked changes as regards
the secondary sex-characters, and, according to
Voronoff, eunuchs are short-lived. It may also
be pointed out that the obesity so common
after castration is not a feature of “the lean and
slippered pantaloon.” Further, after the menopause
the ovaries undergo fibrotic atrophy, and
it appears from Professor Turnbull’s observations
(<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">vide</i> p. 114) that the interstitial cells are
very scanty or absent; further observations
are necessary as to the presence of interstitial
cells in senescent ovaries, but presuming that
they are scanty it would follow, on the hypothesis
that the interstitial cells exert an influence
in preventing the onset of old age, that women
should become old much sooner than men in
whom the interstitial cells are apparently much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
more in evidence. It cannot of course be
admitted that such a difference in the sex
incidence of old age exists. The improved
health and rejuvenation after <i>x</i>-ray treatment for
metrorrhagia and uterine fibromyomas at the
climacteric or post-climacteric age have been
regarded by Steinach and Bordier as due to
hypertrophy of the ovarian interstitial cells
following induced atrophy of the ova, but to
accept this there must be definite evidence that
the interstitial cells are increased in number.
Harrower’s<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">120</a> dictum that the absence of a
hormone provided by the interstitial cells is
responsible for premature senility does not
appear to be borne out by our present knowledge,
but a great deal of further work must be
done before a final decision is justified.</p>

<p>Testicular and ovarian extracts, often in
combination with those of the thyroid and
pituitary, which are known to have a definite
physiological action, have been extensively used
as a panacea. But is there any undeniable
evidence that the extracts of testis and ovary so
far employed have any effect apart from that of
suggestion? According to Frank<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">121</a> the available
ovarian preparations are defatted and thus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
deficient in the potent lipoid extracts; and
very serious doubts as to the activity of testicular
extracts have been expressed by Professor
Cushny.</p>

<p>The possibility must be borne in mind that
the use of thyroid and other gland extracts that
have a definite effect on metabolism is not
devoid of risk to cells that are gradually undergoing
involution; for, by stimulating metabolism
unduly, the existing vitality may be prematurely
exhausted and, though for a time there is a
gratifying show of energy, it is but a flash in the
pan that precedes a more rapid loss of function.
We are irresistibly reminded that “no man
putteth new wine into old bottles: else the
new wine doth burst the bottles.”</p>

<p>At the present time it would be unwise to
express a dogmatic opinion about the relation
of the endocrine glands to normal old age.
That old age is due to endocrine insufficiency
or loss of balance cannot be regarded as proved,
and it is probably safer to regard changes, such
as atrophy, in the various glands of internal
secretion as concomitant with, rather than
causal of, those in the senescent body.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Metchnikoff’s Pathological Explanation</span></h3>

<p>As an alternative to the belief that there is
an inherent quantum of vitality which may be
harmfully or beneficially influenced by environment
and the wear and tear of life, it has been
suggested that the process of ageing depends
solely on external factors and that either there
is no intrinsic limitation to the life of the
organism or that the possibility is entirely cast
into the shade by predominance of extrinsic
influences. This doctrine is free from any
tinge of fatalism and has the advantage that it
is a direct stimulus to efforts in the direction of
hygiene in all its forms; for as things are now
old age owes its discomforts to superadded
and in most instances avoidable complications.
Élie Metchnikoff, as is well known, attributed
the senile accompaniments of advanced years
to pathological and preventible causes, namely
toxaemia induced by alcohol, syphilis, and
especially by bacterial activity in the colon which
in common with Barclay-Smith and Arbuthnot
Lane, he regarded as a harmful phylogenetic
relic, this point of view being expressed by the
epigram “the longer the colon the shorter is
life.” He considered that the putrefactive
bacteria in the colon produce phenol, indol,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
skatol, and aromatic bodies which cause degenerative
changes in the cells of the body;
and that the more resistant macrophages, which
do not attack healthy tissues, absorb the
damaged cells. He therefore employed means
to prevent excessive bacterial activity in the
large intestine, and in addition to care in diet so
as to diminish the risk of introducing bacteria
into the alimentary canal, he advocated the
destruction of putrefactive bacteria in the colon
by means of sour milk and cultures of <i>Bacillus
bulgaricus</i>, which form lactic acid and thus
render the contents of the bowel acid and unsuitable
for the growth of the harmful micro-organisms.
Metchnikoff thoroughly practised
his doctrine, but he did not begin his regime
until he was well over fifty, and, in spite of
several severe illnesses which had damaged his
heart, he lived longer than any of his family and
passed the 70th milestone. His views on the
method of production of senility aroused great
interest and criticism not only from Marinesco,<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">122</a>
Léri,<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">123</a> Sand, Laignel-Lavestine, and Voisin,
who disputed the reality of the macrophages
devouring the cells of the central nervous
system, and Ribbert<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">124</a> who denied the existence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
of such a physiological intoxication and ascribed
old age and death to the inevitable physico-chemical
changes incident to life, but also from
Salimbeni and Gery,<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">125</a> working in the Pasteur
Institute, who while supporting most of his
contentions did not consider that they provided
the whole explanation, <i>e.g.</i>, the involution of
the ovaries at a fixed age was not thus accounted
for. The means Metchnikoff advised
for the postponement of senility and death
were on much broader lines than the popular
conception summed up by “sour milk”
might suggest, for he expounded the philosophy
of orthobiosis or a correct method of
living.</p>

<p>That intestinal toxaemia due to stasis has a
very important influence in producing disease
cannot be doubted, and Sir Arbuthnot Lane<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">126</a>
has brought this prominently to our notice;
while clothing in modern language the old ideas
of the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">primae viae</i> he recalls to our memory
Abernethy’s<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">127</a> panacea for many ills of the flesh,
namely a blue pill at night followed by a mixture
of gentian and senna in the morning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
Among his collaborators Mr. Ernest Clarke<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">128</a>
has insisted on the premature ageing of persons
with intestinal stasis. From the analogy of
syphilis, alcoholism, and other intoxications,
which may produce degenerative changes simulating
those found in old age, the hypothesis of
intestinal toxaemia gains a certain amount of
support, and it may not be so easy to exclude
the agency of intestinal toxaemia as in the case
of syphilis and some intoxications. But intestinal
toxaemia may, as far as can be judged, be
absent in healthy old age, and conversely be
present in early life without causing the phenomena
of old age. Further objections have been
raised:—why should intestinal toxins be harmless
for 40 or 50 years and then exert such a
serious influence? why should women who are
more subject than men to constipation be more
long-lived; and that in constipated persons
the faeces, as shown by Schmidt and Strasburger,
contain fewer living bacteria than in
health.<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">129</a></p>

<p>As applied to normal old age and death this
hypothesis is pathological and therefore has
rather failed to interest those who are working<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
at the biological aspect. Perhaps the most
that can be safely concluded in balancing the
pathological and biological arguments is that
while Metchnikoff’s view may be partially true
it does not account for all senile changes, and
that normal old age or senescence cannot be
regarded as the result of toxins absorbed from
the alimentary canal.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Old Age of Cells and Carcinoma</span></h3>

<p>The relation between ageing of the cells on
the one hand and the development of carcinoma
on the other hand is a subject of great interest.
According to Karl Pearson’s<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">130</a> statistical enquiry
the incidence of carcinoma reaches its maximum
at the age of 46 years in women and 56 years
in men; Lazarus-Barlow<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">131</a> concluded that the
range of years over which cancer is likely to
occur is practically the same in the two sexes,
namely 46 to 64, and that among 4659 cases of
malignant disease there were only 35, or 0·7
per cent, over 80 years of age.<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">132</a> The cancer age,
therefore, coincides with the waning of maturity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
and the onset of old age; that carcinoma is
rare in very old persons is also shown by
the occurrence of one case only among 71
centenarians collected by Sir George Humphry.
Laurent<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">133</a> considered that whereas longevity
depends on a condition of vital equilibrium,
the development of cancer is due to a want of
this equilibrium, to a state of anarchy, and
that the factors disposing to orderly vitality
are conducive to longevity and antagonistic to
the development of new growth. The reason
why malignant growths are prone to appear
with the onset of old age has naturally been
the subject of much debate. According to
Thiersch degeneration lessens the controlling
influence normally exerted by connective tissue
on epithelium, the inherent proliferative capacity
of which then runs riot. Ribbert believed
that from loss of resistance or diminution of
surface tension in the connective tissues post-natal
“rests” of epithelium were produced as
the result of irritation and that these displaced
cells then grew because there was no controlling
opposition. Adami suggested a reversion
of the highly specialized epithelial cells to a
simpler form with powers of proliferation, the
cumulative habit of growth taking the place<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
of the habit of work, and practically anticipated
the more modern view. According to Hastings
Gilford<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">134</a> malignant disease is a premature cell
senility and the result of the partial reversion
of immature or adult cells to an embryonic or
quasi-embryonic state. From a study of senescence
in dogs Goodpasture<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">135</a> concludes that
degenerative changes in the cells lead not only
to death of some cells but to dedifferentiation
of others, which, becoming simpler in structure
and function, recover their juvenile power of
growth in varying degrees, and that hence
metaplasia and tumour growths occur as
accidents of commencing old age. A little
later Oertel<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">136</a> insisted on his view that cancer
is not an embryonic reversion or a specific
change in the cell but a phenomenon of
senescence—a degenerative proliferation depending
upon disturbances in the nucleus
plasma relations, specifically upon the loss of
nuclear chromosomes; from age or degeneration
the tumour cell loses the higher functional
chromosomes and retains the genetically older
and more resistant ones controlling reproduction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
and vegetative activities; thus there arises
a race of cells without the differentiation of
undegenerated cells.</p>

<p>These various expressions of opinion would
justify the conclusion that with the onset of
old age the degenerative processes in the cells
lead to the production of less specialized cells
which have the compensating property of more
vigorous growth, and that in certain circumstances,
one of which is very probably a
diminished power of resistance on the part of
the surrounding tissues and another, and very
important one, irritation in some form or
another, riotous proliferation of the cells invades
the adjacent parts. That the conditions
necessary are usually local is strongly suggested
by the appearance of the new growth at one
spot only and by the frequent absence of
recurrence after free removal. There may be
a premature local senescence of the tissues,
just as there is premature old age of the body
generally, and this would explain the exceptional
occurrence of malignant disease in
early life or long before the usual time.</p>

pathological changes, is extremely
rare; pathological processes may initiate and
hurry on a condition imitating old age, and
indeed the morbid changes found after death
in old people commonly show the lesions of
past infections in addition to those of physiological
involution, and the longer life lasts the
greater the probability that changes due to
disease will accumulate. It is therefore difficult
to determine accurately where physiological
involution ends and pathological lesions begin,
and there has been much confusion between
physiological old age and pathological senility.
It must, on the other hand, be admitted that
the ideal condition of physiological involution<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
without some definite evidence of superadded
pathological change hardly ever comes before
us. In fact at the best old age is almost
always but relatively physiological, in other
words, as Metchnikoff wrote in 1903, there is
at present, from the conditions of inharmonious
environment, no chance of a really physiological
old age and death for mankind. But the view
that old age is invariably the accumulated
product of multiple injuries due to infection
and poisons, or that it is due to arteriosclerosis
(Boerhaave, Haller, Demange) is an
entirely different proposition and does not fit
in with biological knowledge. While fully
recognizing the difficulties an attempt may be
made to tabulate the natural changes accompanying
and responsible for old age, and to contrast
them with the pathological changes commonly
complicating the normal structural involution
of the human body.</p>

<p>The general atrophy of old age, as grossly
shown by loss of weight, does not proceed
equally in all parts of the body. The supporting
fibrous tissues of the body and organs
certainly atrophy less than the nobler, because
actively functional, cells of the organs; it is
difficult to estimate the atrophy of the fibrous
tissues, for from shrinkage of the parenchyma<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
of organs and of muscles the fibrous framework
stands out in greater prominence. Some
proliferation or replacement fibrosis follows
atrophy of the nobler tissues, and pathologically
infection may cause fibrosis. But that the
fibrous tissue does to some extent share in the
general atrophy is rendered probable on the
analogy of the change in the allied tissue of
bone which undergoes rarefaction and thinning.
The subcutaneous and perivisceral stores of
fat diminish out of proportion to the fibrous
supporting tissues around them. The place of
the fat in the fat cells may be taken by fluid—serous
atrophy—or the cells may simply
revert to the condition of connective tissue
cells. In passing it may be pointed out that it
is curious that with the diminished metabolism
of old age the stores of fat are not increased as
they are in similar circumstances in adult life;
Is it due to a widespread atrophy of the connective
tissue cells that store fat? If so, an
accumulation of fat in the liver might be
expected, but this is not so. Possibly it is the
result of deficient assimilation. The heart,
as Councilman<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">137</a> has shown, is on the whole
better preserved than the other organs; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
it might well be argued that the existence of
such a cardiac condition is a determining factor
in the attainment of advanced age.</p>

<p><i>The skin</i> is dry, thin, smooth, glossy from
atrophy, inelastic like parchment, and is
wrinkled from degeneration and disappearance
of the elastic tissue, subcutaneous fat and
muscular fibre. These changes are most advanced
on the face, especially the forehead,
and backs of the hands from exposure. The
degeneration of the elastic fibres, recently
studied by Kissmeyer and With,<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">138</a> gives a
characteristic mesh-like appearance, depending
on the rigid wrinkles, to the skin, which takes
a yellow tint. The ivory pallor and coldness
are due to the diminution in the capillaries;
the skin may show areas of pigmentation and
leucodermia—changes described by Sir Lenthal
Cheatle as due to the wear and tear of life
(biotripsy); in a woman aged 93 Salimbeni
and Gery described almost complete disappearance
of the papillae and of the collagen fibres.
The pigmentation has been regarded as a
means of protection, for there is a relation
between it and malignant disease, the latter
being prone to occur when pigmentation fails<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
(Pringle<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">139</a>). These atrophic changes are far
commoner on the backs than on the palms of
the hands, and it is noteworthy that among
Cheatle’s<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">140</a> 200 collected cases of malignant
disease of the hand there was one only on the
palm. The subcutaneous fat is diminished in
amount, which is regarded by Sir Arbuthnot
Lane, though not with any special reference to
old age, as one of the many results of colonic
toxaemia. The yellow fat contains excess of
cholesterol. There is diminished secretion by
the sweat and sebaceous glands, and from
this cause and the diminished vascularity there
is less loss of heat to correspond with the slower
metabolism.</p>

<p><i>Hair.</i>—Greying or whitening of the hair
occurs commonly in old age, but not universally
for some centenarians have retained the
natural colour of the hair; coarse jet-black
hair is specially prone to whiten early. The
change in colour has been ascribed by Metchnikoff
to the action of phagocytes (chromophages)
which invade the roots of the hairs
and carry off the pigment granules. Like the
arcus senilis it may occur quite early in life<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
and without any other indication of age, and
is often hereditary; as the sage of Norwich
wrote, “Hairs make fallible Predictions, and
many Temples early Gray have outlived the
Psalmist’s Period.”<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">141</a> Lord Bacon<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">142</a> indeed
said, “Hasty gray hairs, without baldness, is
a token of long time; contrarily, if they be
accompanied by baldness.” But baldness is
often due to seborrhoea and so only secondarily
connected with advanced age. In some rare
instances the hair already grey or white has
been known to regain its normal colour; the
late Sir Charles Cameron<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">143</a> recorded this event
in his own life after an accident confining
him to bed for some months in his eightieth
year, and refers to the hair of a man aged
90 years returning to its original brown
colour; cases were also reported by Graves.<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">144</a>
Velasquez de Tarente<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">145</a> recorded an abbess
who after an illness which promised to be fatal
in her hundredth year had a crop of brown
hair, and, like Sir Charles Cameron, put on
weight. Four other cases are given by Sir<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
John Sinclair<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">146</a> in persons aged 80, 104, 105,
and 114 years. Baldness may be definitely due
to thyroid insufficiency and not to atrophy of
the hair follicles and sebaceous glands.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A pensioner aged 75, whom I saw with Major R. J.
C. Thompson, in the Royal Hospital, Chelsea, with
baldness and a grey beard, was given thyroid extract, as
he was thought to have hypothyroidism; his general
condition then improved wonderfully, and his scalp
became covered with dark brown hair which had to be
cut at intervals. Parkinsonian tremor was rather more
obvious during the first six months that he was on
thyroid treatment.</p></blockquote>

<p>The hair of the body may become scanty
and lose its tendency to curl. Excessive
growth of hair (hypertrichosis) in women after
the menopause is an indication of disordered
endocrine balance (loss of ovarian internal
secretion?) and is only so far an accompaniment
of age; it may be seen in comparatively
young women from various causes.</p>

<p><i>The nails</i> are often longitudinally ridged,
brittle, hard, and thickened; but onychogryphosis
is rather the result of neglect or of
disease than solely of old age.</p>

<p><i>The brain</i> as a natural result of atrophy
becomes lighter; Boyd’s<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">147</a> tables show that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
the male brain is 3 oz., and the female brain
4 oz., lighter in persons over 80 years of age
than in the decade 20 to 30. The convolutions,
therefore, become separated and the
amount of cerebrospinal fluid greater. The
atrophy is not uniform, being less in the posterior
third than in the anterior two-thirds. The
nerve cells become smaller, pigmented, and
degenerate. The brain is said by Cerlette to
be affected by a process special to old age—miliary
necroses scattered over the cortex
and associated with changes in the small
arteries which show remarkable knots; a
condition which suggests a pathological softening
secondary to arteriosclerosis, especially as the
change does not come on constantly at a definite
age period. Cavities with thickened walls,
possibly due to miliary haemorrhages, or to
softening around the vessels are also described.
Metchnikoff’s description of phagocytic destruction
of the nerve cells by macrophages has
been seriously questioned and thought to be
based on erroneous observation, the glia cells
being regarded as macrophages (Marinesco).</p>

<p>The spinal cord shows an increased number
of amyloid bodies, some diffuse sclerosis, often
obliteration, by epithelial proliferation, of the
central canal, and atrophy with pigmentation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
of the nerve cells, especially in the anterior
cornua. The membranes may contain small
calcareous plaques.</p>

<p><i>The arcus senilis</i>, due to infiltration with
fats, especially cholesterol and lipochrome, and
to degeneration of elastic tissue at the periphery
of the cornea, is often associated with arteriosclerosis
(Monauni<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">148</a>). It is not a necessary
accompaniment of age; among 321 persons
over 80 years of age, it was absent in 114,
or 35·5 per cent (Humphry); and it is well
known that like grey hair, it may occur in
those young in years. Nascher,<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">149</a> the author of
<cite>Geriatrics</cite>, had an arcus senilis as a schoolboy.
Rigidity and flattening of the crystalline lens
lead to presbyopia, which may be premature
and due to toxaemia, among the causes of
which Ernest Clarke<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">150</a> gives intestinal toxaemia
a high place. The power of accommodation is
also impaired by weakness of the ciliary muscle
brought about in the same way.</p>

<p><i>Skeleton.</i>—The atrophy characteristic of
senescence is well shown in the fixed tissues
of the bony skeleton. Though the bones do
not as a rule alter materially in size or shape,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
they do so markedly in substance from rarefaction
and absorption, the latter taking place
mainly from the inside of the bones and
especially the cancellous tissue, the medullary
cavity and the Haversian canals becoming
larger (senile osteoporosis). Hence fractures
near the joints, particularly intracapsular fracture
of the neck of the femur, are favoured. The
absorption of the alveolar border of the jaw
is intimately connected with the loss of the
teeth, and brings the mental foramen to the
top of the edentulous mandible. The angle
of the jaw at the junction of the body and
the ramus now opens out and comes to resemble
that of an infant. It is often stated that
the angle of junction of the neck and shaft
of the femur becomes less, more of a right angle,
but Humphry regarded this as exceptional.</p>

<p>From muscular weakness the back becomes
bent and as a result the vertebrae become
altered in shape. Ossification of the anterior
common spinous ligament—a change analogous
to rheumatoid osteophytes around the more
movable joints—is an added and not uncommon
change but, like calcification of the costal and
laryngeal cartilages, it is a morbid process,
and when advanced constitutes spondylitis
deformans. The intervertebral discs undergo<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
some loss of elasticity and atrophy, thus contributing
to the loss of height. The cranial
bones are usually thinned, and the parietal
bones may show symmetrical or nearly symmetrical
oval areas of excessive absorption of
the outer and even of the inner table, so that
the epicranium and the dura mater may be in
contact. These areas which are close to the
longitudinal fissure must not in the case of
ancient skulls be mistaken for examples of
early trephining. The bony sutures tend to
become obliterated. Instead of thinning and
loss of weight the skull, especially the vault,
may show thickening and be heavier than
normal—a change involving chiefly the inner
surface and ascribed by Sir George Humphry
to shrinkage of the brain.</p>

<p>Calcification of the costal and laryngeal
cartilages, which have a yellow tint from fatty
change, is, like a similar change in the arteries,
pathological and not part of the process of
senescence. Thus among 10 recorded necropsies
on centenarians the costal cartilages
were calcified in 2 only. Calcification of the
costal cartilages interferes with the respiratory
movements and was regarded by Sir George
Humphry, who tested for it by estimating the
elasticity perceived when gentle pressure is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
exerted on the lower part of the sternum, as a
bad omen for the future.</p>

<p><i>The teeth</i> are usually, but not invariably,
few in the aged, for care or lack of it, the
accumulated effect of long-continued mechanical
injuries, altered calcium metabolism, and
diminished resistance to infection will necessarily
influence the amount of decay. Statistics,
especially Humphry’s, show that in extreme
old age very few teeth are present, and it is
tempting to correlate the diminished provision
for mastication with the lessened need for food.
Sir Isaac Newton, however, at the age of 85
was said to have lost one tooth only. The
numerous reputed instances of a third dentition
can be explained only by the appearance of
a previously buried tooth through the atrophying
gums, for a genuine third dentition would
necessitate the presence of dental germs which
do not exist.</p>

<p><i>The gastro-intestinal tract</i> shows atrophy of
the muscular coat and its secreting glands, so
that dilatation of the thin-walled, pale stomach
and colon occur on less provocation than in
adult life and digestion is impaired; from
lack of mucous secretion combined with loss
of motor vigour constipation is common. It
may be added that hypertrophy of the prostate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
by interfering with peristalsis of the colon has
been thought to cause gerontal constipation
(Hollis<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">151</a>). The pancreas shows fibrotic atrophy
and becomes smaller and harder. From the
loss of fat and muscular atrophy visceroptosis
is not uncommon.</p>

<p><i>The liver</i> diminishes in size and weight by
about one half; atrophy of considerable areas
may expose the vessels and ducts on the surface
of the organ. Boyd’s tables show a difference
of 18 oz. between the weights in persons in
the decade 20–30 and in those over 80.
Microscopically atrophy of the lobules and of
the cells in the centres of the lobules have been
described (Luciani<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">152</a>), but the latter change is
not constant, for in a woman of 93 Salimbeni
and Gery<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">153</a> definitely noted that the cells were
not atrophied. That such atrophy of the
liver cells is pathological is perhaps supported
by D. Symmers’s<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">154</a> observation that in the
pancreas of such cases the islands of Langerhans
may show moderate enlargement, as if to compensate
for failure of the glycogenic function
of the liver. Pigmentation of the cells by a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
lipochrome is excessive, and the name brown
atrophy has been applied to the condition
which is seen in the other viscera of the old.</p>

<p><i>The lungs</i> become smaller, lighter, and the
elastic tissue degenerates; this is atrophous
emphysema, and the chest capacity diminishes.
Roussy and Leroux<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">155</a> found that these lungs
commonly show endarteritis obliterans and
fibrosis, conditions which favour infarction,
infection, and the terminal bronchopneumonia
to which the aged are so prone.</p>

<p><i>The voluntary muscles</i>, according to Durante,<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">156</a>
contain many fibres with large globules of
fat; but Jewesbury and Topley,<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">157</a> who describe
coarse fat globules mingled with brown pigment
in the immediate neighbourhood of the
muscle nuclei in 50 per cent of cases of various
kinds, and almost constantly in old subjects,
regard this condition as independent of true
fatty degeneration, and are doubtful if it has
any pathological significance. Excessive fatty
and fibrotic change is found in cases of senile
paraplegia without any lesion in the spinal
cord or brain.</p>

<p><i>Heart.</i>—Some difference of opinion exists<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
as to the condition of the heart; Parkes
Weber<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">158</a> says that the only true senile change
is diminution in size and weight; this as it
is worded is no doubt correct; but pure
atrophy is less rare in the heart than in most
parts of the senile body. Charcot<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">159</a> indeed
stated that it does not atrophy in old age,
but preserves the dimensions of middle life.
The heart may even hypertrophy in old people;
this is pathological; Councilman<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">160</a> found it
in 248, or 43 per cent, of 580 persons over
60 years of age, and could not refer it to aortic
or renal arteriosclerosis or to the diminished
capillary area in the skin; but the average
blood pressure 158 systolic/88 diastolic of the cases with
cardiac hypertrophy was higher than that
130/78 of the others.</p>

<p>Fatty degeneration of the myocardium is
very frequent; Charcot stated that at the Salpêtrière
it was almost constant in old women,
but according to Councilman there is no clear
evidence that it produces permanent injury or
functional insufficiency; he noted some fibrosis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
in 15 per cent of his cases. Atrophy of the
epicardial fat—serous atrophy—is common,
and increase of the so-called lipochrome pigment
in the muscular fibres which become
smaller and fewer—brown atrophy—is frequent
as it is in the other organs in old age.</p>

<p>Chronic valvulitis and subendocardial fibrosis
are, like arteriosclerosis, common morbid
changes.</p>

<p><i>Arteriosclerosis</i>, contrary to what has been
stated by Huchard and others, is not constant
in a considerable degree in old people, and
therefore cannot, as Demange and others considered,
be regarded as the cause of the atrophic
changes seen in old age. Arteriosclerosis is
due to several factors, namely, infection and
intoxication of various kinds and to damage
caused by long-continued high arterial blood pressure.
The primary changes are degeneration
and weakness, however brought about, in
the middle coat. Ophülz<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">161</a> has recently discussed
the question whether the degeneration
is entirely or largely a senile change; if it were
so, the curve of the incidence of arterial sclerosis
would begin gradually about the age of 40
years, so as to include premature cases, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
rise slowly until the age of 55 years, when there
would be a sudden increase to 80 or 90 per
cent, and at the age of 70 it would be improbable
that any one would be free from well-marked
arteriosclerosis. He found that the
curve of incidence was very different from this;
beginning much earlier its rise is gradual all
the way without any sudden increase, and indeed
seems, if anything, to be retarded by old age.
Old persons may have practically healthy
arteries, so, although arteriosclerosis may undoubtedly
produce atrophy and senile changes
in the tissues and organs by diminishing the
blood supply, for example in the case of the
red granular kidney, it cannot be regarded as
the causal factor in healthy old age.</p>

<p>The primary calcification of the middle coat,
sometimes called Mönckeberg’s sclerosis, which
leads to the formation of regular rings in the
degenerated muscular media and the “pipe-stem”
arteries associated with senile gangrene,
may be independent of, or combined with,
endarterial sclerosis. It follows fatty degeneration
of the media, which is the commonest
form of medial degeneration in the aged, and
specially picks out the elastic fibres.<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">162</a> The
femoral, tibial, radial arteries and the aorta are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
most often affected. It is difficult to estimate
its incidence, but that it is not very common, at
any rate in a high degree, seems probable from
the comparative infrequency of its detection in
<i>x</i>-ray examinations of the lower limbs in old
people. It would be natural to associate its
occurrence with the rarefaction of bone that
goes on in advanced life, and so to consider it
as in some respects different from the secondary
calcification in endarteritic sclerosis; in answer
to an enquiry Professor W. T. Councilman of
Harvard kindly wrote to me that he did not
regard calcification as characteristic of any
particular type of arterial disease, lime salts
being in certain cases more easily deposited in
any pre-existing lesions. Klotz describes fatty
and calcareous change in the middle third of
the media of the aorta as quite characteristic of
senescence.</p>

<p>Cazalis’s famous aphorism “man is as old
as his arteries” is true in so far that the state
of the arteries is a good index of the general
condition, for they are extremely prone to suffer
as the result of infection, toxaemia, and strain;
strictly speaking, therefore, the state of the
arteries is not so much an index of the individual’s
age as of his adventures.</p>

<p>Phlebosclerosis, analogous to arteriosclerosis,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
is common, and dilatation, often due to stagnation
and lack of the normal <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">vis a tergo</i>, of the
veins is a familiar change in the aged.</p>

<p>The capillary area is diminished in the skin
and elsewhere, but not uncommonly there are
dilated venules or angiomas on the skin; the
latter, commoner on the trunk and upper limbs
and in men, were formerly known as “de Morgan’s
spots” and were thought to accompany
cancer, but the association is only due to a
rough correspondence of their age incidence.</p>

<p><i>The blood</i> of healthy octogenarians may not
show any departure from that of the earlier
periods of life as regards the number of the
reds and the amount of haemoglobin (Hansen<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">163</a>),
though some have described a secondary
anaemia. Thus in a female centenarian Macnaughton<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">164</a>
found slight secondary anaemia with
a normal number of leucocytes, the differential
count showing a relative lymphocytosis. The
red bone marrow diminishes, its place being
taken by fat cells.</p>

<p><i>The lymphoid tissues</i> undergo atrophy all over
the body including the leucoblastic bone
marrow, but though it does not appear that the
blood shows any definite change in the leucocyte<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
count it is tempting to correlate the diminution
of resistance to acute infections, such as pneumonia
and erysipelas, with the atrophy of the
lymphoid tissue. The alimentary canal often
shows lymphoid atrophy in a high degree, but
two normal Peyer’s patches were present in a
man reputed to be 106 years old (G. Rolleston<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">165</a>).</p>

<p><i>The spleen</i>, in common with the lymphoid
tissues elsewhere, shows atrophy, sometimes to
an extreme degree, so that instead of the normal
weight of 7 oz. it weighs a few drams only.
The capsule is thrown into folds, and is somewhat
opaque; from atrophy of the pulp and
Malpighian corpuscles the vessels and fibrous
trabeculae become prominent. <i>The thymus</i>,
contrary to the general opinion that it undergoes
involution long before puberty, has been
found by Hammar<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">166</a> to increase in size up to
puberty when involution begins, but proceeds
so gradually that even in old age it is functional.</p>

<p>The <i>thyroid</i>, unless there is cystic change, is
smaller than natural; thus out of 40 thyroid
glands from individuals between the ages of six
months and 77 years the smallest was in a
woman aged 77 (Hale-White<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">167</a>). In colour it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
is darkish brown and on section rather dry.
Dr. Donaldson, Lecturer on Pathology at St.
George’s Hospital, has specially examined 19
thyroid glands from patients between the ages
of 57 and 93; of these five showed cystic
change; they all showed increase in the amount
of fibrous tissue which was progressive with
age, and in the absence of cystic change the
size of the vesicles and amount of colloid
material were diminished.</p>

<p><i>The Parathyroids.</i>—From examination of a
number of specimens Dr. Donaldson finds that
in old people the parathyroids appear to be free
from retrogressive changes, but he cautiously
requires further experience before concluding
that this is the rule.</p>

<p>The <i>adrenals</i> show involutionary atrophy in
common with the body as a whole, but sometimes
the cortex is enlarged from excess of
lipoids, usually associated with considerable
atheroma, and may also show adenomas. As
the increase in size of the adrenals is cortical its
relation to high blood pressure, if any, is that of
a remote result, namely from arteriosclerosis,
and not causal as has been suggested. According
to G. M. Findlay<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">168</a> the amount of lipochrome<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
in the cells of the adrenals increases
with advancing years and is accompanied by
the appearance of melanin in their nuclei.</p>

<p>The <i>kidneys</i> show definite atrophy, and
Councilman,<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">169</a> who has recently made a study of
them in 580 persons over 60 years of age, calls
the condition chronic atrophic nephropathy.
The fat in the renal pelvis is more obvious than
usual, the capsules are slightly thickened and
occasionally but by no means always adherent,
the surface finely rough and sometimes showing
small cysts, but the large and irregular depressions
characteristic of a granular kidney are
not common. There are, however, areas of
fibrosis, and the cortex and medulla are equally
atrophied. Microscopically some glomeruli
are fibroid, others smaller than natural. In
three-fourths of his cases the renal vessels
showed arteriosclerosis due to primary atrophy
of the media with compensatory hypertrophy
of the intima; but Councilman gives reasons
for hesitation in accepting the obvious conclusion
that the senile kidney is the result of the
vascular change.</p>

<p><i>The prostate</i> shows some degrees of enlargement
after the age of fifty in the vast majority<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
of men, but in only a percentage of these are
there symptoms referable to it. Kenneth
Walker<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">170</a> finds that the maximum size is reached
at the age of 60 and that from then onwards
there is a slow diminution in size; among 340
men between 80 and 90 there were 11, or 3·2
per cent, and among 92 men between 90 and
100 one only with hypertrophy of the prostate
(Humphry). The causation of prostatic hypertrophy
has been much discussed; that its
association with arteriosclerosis (Launois<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">171</a>) is
anything more than a coincidence, the two
conditions being common in the later years of
life, seems improbable; Walker found the two
associated in 10 per cent, and he regards the
change as part of a general enlargement and
thickening of the peri-urethral, sub-cervical,
and sub-trigonal glands, and, as the interstitial
cells in the testes become fewer and degenerated,
he considers that the prostatic enlargement is
possibly a degeneration connected with a disturbance
of the endocrine balance. Nemenow<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">172</a>
argued that prostatic enlargement was due to
proliferation of the interstitial cells following
senile atrophy of the seminal tubules of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
testes, but K. Walker found that in prostatic
enlargement the interstitial cells are diminished
rather than increased in number. An interesting
parallel has been drawn between the involutionary
changes in the mamma and the
prostate, and it is probable that the same underlying
factor is at work in both (Walker, Paul).
Hertoghe<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">173</a> regarded some cases of prostatic
hypertrophy as due to senile dysthyroidism, and
recently benefit has been reported from thyroid
medication and also from prostatic extract.
Dr. Leonard Williams has told me of cases, as
yet unpublished, showing well-marked relief of
symptoms and diminution in the size of prostatic
enlargement after doses of thyroid extract
(½ grain once) and colloidal iodine (one dram
three times) daily. The prostatic plexus of veins
is often enlarged and may contain phleboliths.</p>

<p>The <i>testes</i> become smaller, softer, and
commonly show some atrophy of the tubules
with disappearance of the epithelial lining and
thickening of the basement membrane; but
the testes of old men may be free from any
such change and the spermatozoa in the
vesiculae seminales may be active. According
to K. Walker the interstitial cells gradually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
diminish in number from the age of 30, but
they may be present in men over 80, and Mott<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">174</a>
remarks that their persistence may account for
an increased and perverted sexual appetite, due
to stimulation of the desire without the power
to perform the sexual act.</p>

<p>The <i>penis</i> becomes smaller, often retracted,
the <i>glans</i> harder, and the <i>scrotum</i> smaller.</p>

<p>The <i>ovaries</i> become shrivelled and fibrotic;
the ova disappear or small cysts may form. It
is difficult to find statements about the presence
or absence of interstitial cells in the senile
ovary. Professor Turnbull has kindly informed
me that in old women an occasional
cell which might be, but is not certainly, an
interstitial cell is visible, and that if they are
interstitial cells their number must be small
and their development poor.</p>

<p>The <i>uterus</i> becomes small, its cavity round,
and the cervical canal may be obliterated.
The <i>external genitals</i> atrophy.</p>

<p>The <i>mamma</i> in women shows involution
changes and when excessive (cystic disease)
these may, as Paul<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">175</a> has pointed out, be compared
with prostatic enlargement in the male.</p>

<span class="subhead">PHYSIOLOGY OF OLD AGE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The basis of the physiology of old age is
progressive diminution in functional activity,
which corresponds to the characteristic structural
atrophy of the organs and tissues. Thus the
lowered functional activity of its glands is
manifest in the dry skin; according to Haneborg<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">176</a>
there is usually a fall in the percentage
of hydrochloric acid in the gastric juice,
though Bell<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">177</a> disputes this. The lessened
amount of mucus from the intestine probably
plays some part in the tendency to constipation.
Other evidences of lowered metabolic rate are
seen in the diminished efficiency of the acid-base
equilibrium (MacNider<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">178</a>) and the increased
degree of urea-nitrogen in the blood, as shown
in 50 per cent of 41 persons between 70 and
88 years of age examined by Rappleye.<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">179</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
<i>Temperature.</i>—Before the era of the clinical
thermometer it was supposed that the body
temperature of the aged was below normal.
This belief was part of the ancient view that
the cause of old age was exhaustion by the
natural heat of the radical moisture which, like
lamp oil, supported the innate heat and with
the passage of years could not be supplied as
perfectly as before; as a result of this loss of
radical moisture the body was thought gradually
to dry and cool.<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">180</a> But it is now known that
the internal temperature is almost constant
at all ages, and Charcot proved that the only
real difference is that the axillary is lower
than the rectal reading; this is due to the
diminished vascularity of the skin and to the
corresponding fall in the loss of heat, which
again may be correlated with the lower metabolic
rate of old age. Aub and Dubois’<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">181</a>
observations on six men between 77 and
83 years of age, mainly with arteriosclerosis,
granular kidney, and emphysema, showed that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
the basal metabolism was 12 per cent below
the average for men between 20 and 50.</p>

<p>Blunting of sensibility to pain is a beneficent
process, suggesting that with the gradual
process of involution and approach to a
physiological death the need for the warning
normally conveyed by symptoms is no longer
needed. This is connected with the simultaneous
atrophy of the nervous tissues which
look after the conduction, perception, and
reference of pain. The latency of disease, as
shown by an absence of the characteristic
symptoms observed in earlier adult life, is often
remarkable in the aged. Thus death may occur
suddenly from extensive but entirely unsuspected
pneumonia; the passage of biliary
or urinary calculi may be unaccompanied by
the violent colic of these events in ordinary
cases, and extensive malignant disease may
exist without any definite localizing discomfort.
This failure in the power to react is also shown
in fevers and infections (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">vide</i> p. 142).</p>

<p>Cutaneous sensation is little affected, and
indeed the aged are very sensitive to cold.
Taste and smell are impaired, and presbyopia
is due to changes in the crystalline lens. The
pupils are contracted and the iris sluggish.
From weakness of the orbicularis palpebrarum<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
muscle ectropion and epiphora may noticeably
change the facial appearance. With advancing
years hearing commonly becomes less acute
from various causes, and after 60 there is a
successive decrease in the number of persons
with normal hearing. According to Albert
Gray<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">182</a> there is probably a characteristic form
of deafness for the higher notes of Galton’s
whistle in all old people, even when for all
practical purposes there is no obvious defect
or tinnitus; this he regards as due to progressive
atrophy of the ligamentum spirale.
Chronic progressive labyrinthine deafness, due
to atrophy of the auditory nerve and fibrosis
of the ductus cochleariae, is the most common
condition in persons over 60. Fixation of the
stapes frequently causes deafness, and the
sequels of middle-ear disease accumulate with
advancing years. Gouty eczema of the external
auditory meatus and collections of wax may
seriously interfere with hearing. Tinnitus in
the elderly is commonly associated with high
blood pressure and arteriosclerosis.</p>

<p><i>Appetite</i> for food is sometimes capricious;
old people may eat excessively, possibly because
the pleasures of the table are the only ones to
which they feel equal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
<i>Muscular movement</i> is slow and somewhat
uncertain, and the reflexes are diminished
except in the presence of sclerosis of the spinal
cord. According to Moebius the <em>knee-jerk</em> is
often absent in normal old persons, but
Sternberg, by employing methods of reinforcement
not available in Moebius’ time,
found that it was invariably present even in
the tenth decade.</p>

<p>The <i>sleep</i> of the aged is less continuous, and
from interruptions often appears to them to
be much less than it really is. There is often a
tendency to irregularity, bad and good nights
alternating. But too much attention to disturbed
sleep in the aged must be avoided, as
hypnotics are inadvisable, and it has been
urged by Sir Hermann Weber and others that
too much sleep is more harmful than too little.</p>

<p>In old age the <em>mental condition</em> varies in
different individuals according to their previous
character and their present physical state.
Freedom from sexual and other perturbations
often renders the minds of old people calm,
tolerant, less susceptible to disappointed ambition,
and philosophic when the part of spectator
has been accepted in place of that of actor in
life’s drama. In what may be regarded as
normal old age psychical activity diminishes;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
not only do initiative, elasticity, and originality
fail, but new ideas and fresh lines of thought
are assimilated with difficulty; hence the old
are commonly conservative and <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">laudatores temporis
acti</i>. Mental fatigue occurs more readily
and the power of concentration and attention
is impaired so that the old may appear deaf;
the mind begins to show disintegration and
a return to the primitive condition in which
each act demands individual care; it has
indeed been said that old age is nothing but
progressive fatigue. A less agile memory
for names is commonly one of the early
symptoms of senescence, and long precedes the
characteristic loss of memory for recent events
while that for the remote past remains, as if
the nerve cells were photographic plates which
in course of time have all become occupied
with impressions. With commencing failure
of memory there is often a tendency to make the
same remark or tell the same story repeatedly,
to mislay things, and unconsciously to become
careless about personal appearance and habits.
As a kind of protest against the inevitable there
may, in the early stage of old age, be a tendency
to ape the young and to conceal the true age;
thus a man may remove the date of his birth
from <cite>Who’s Who</cite> and books of reference, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
a mother may delay the “coming-out” of her
daughter. On the other hand, at a later stage
there may be the opposite desire to appear a
wonderful prodigy of senescence. The old
are notoriously less subject to feel the loss of
relatives and friends by death; they become
more self-centred; this may be because retirement
from active work switches their minds on to
their own feelings, and possibly in part depends
on loss of touch with the external world, resulting
from failure of the sense organs. This
when exaggerated develops into selfish dependence
and demands on relatives. Senile
vanity is not uncommon, and Eden Phillpotts<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">183</a>
remarks that all old people love to be in the
centre of the stage, one of the pathetic things
in life being that they are seldom allowed to be
there. The ego-centric frame of mind may
lead to hypochondriasis with fads and meticulous
attention to details of personal health and to
experiments in diet and patent medicines.
Loss of control, due to failure of the higher
centres, engenders restlessness, garrulity, emotional
weakness, and peevishness. There may
be considerable variation in the moods, so that
the deep depression of one day may vanish the
next, and irritability and apathy may alternate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
Regression, which closely corresponds to
the “devolution” of Hughlings Jackson, who
argued that in disease the organism tends to
retrace the steps of its development, accounts
for the phenomena of “the second childhood.”
Thus the old are prone to nervous apprehension,
and liable to suggestion and to hysteria which
Rivers<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">184</a> defined as a protective mechanism
representing a recrudescence of the reaction
to danger in an early stage of animal development.
Will power, like their gait, becomes
hesitant and uncertain. This devolutionary
change progresses partially and not universally;
memory for personal names, as mentioned
above, is often the first to fail, because, like the
mathematical faculty, it has from the attendant
difficulty a high place in the order of mental
processes; hence forgetfulness of personal
names is a criterion of psychical fatigue and
neurasthenia (Dupuis<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">185</a>).</p>

<p>In old animals it is natural for the instinct
of self-preservation to fade, as is exemplified
in the day-flies which in their larval stage are
well endowed with this property, and as their
end draws near animals seem to acquire an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
instinct for death comparable to that for sleep.
But in human beings, although they usually
dislike old age, there is generally what Matthew
Arnold<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">186</a> called “a passionate, absorbing, almost
bloodthirsty clinging to life.” Metchnikoff
specially investigated this point and found
hardly any instances in which death was
anticipated with the same feelings of pleasure
as is sleep by the weary. Considering the
discomforts of many old people it is rather
remarkable how very seldom they endorse the
words of the burial service: “We give thee
hearty thanks for that it hath pleased thee to
deliver this our brother out of the miseries
of this sinful world.” Various explanations
have been offered for this want of harmony
between the mental and physical states of the
old; it has been ascribed to the idea of eternal
punishment, and to the presence of pathological
conditions which bring on senility and death
prematurely and thus alter what should be
the normal mental attitude of healthy old age.
In speaking of the usual fear of death in old
people it should be mentioned that shortly
before death this commonly disappears and, as
G. E. Day,<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">187</a> R. W. Mackenna,<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">188</a> and Thompson<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
and Todd point out, the aged when seriously ill
commonly regard death as a welcome release;
the famous William Hunter’s last words in
his sixty-fifth year expressed his sense of
resignation: “If I had strength enough to
hold a pen, I would write how easy and pleasant
a thing it is to die.”</p>

<p><i>The Cardio-Vascular System.</i>—The pulse rate
is usually rather increased in frequency as
compared with that in adult life; extra-systoles
are so common in persons who appear
otherwise normal that they cannot be regarded
as having any important significance. Among
Sir George Humphry’s collection of 824 persons
over 80 years of age one-fifth had an irregular
or intermittent pulse.</p>

<p>Although, like arteriosclerosis, a well-marked
high blood pressure without evidence of renal
disease, to which Sir Clifford Allbutt has given
the name of senile plethora or hyperpiesia, is
common in the decline of life, it is a pathological
and not a physiological change; and
a distinction must be drawn between the
gradually rising blood pressure seen from
birth onwards and an increase above that
normal to an arterio-vascular system that has
been active for over half a century. In the
same way the venous pressure increases with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
age (Hooker<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">189</a>). That a definitely high blood
pressure in the aged is pathological appears
to be shown by observations quoted by Councilman
from the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital,
Boston; among 94 patients (male and female)
averaging 66 years of age, 44 per cent with
cardiac hypertrophy as shown by necropsy,
had an average blood pressure of 158 systolic / 88 diastolic,
whereas the 56 per cent without cardiac hypertrophy
had an average blood pressure of 130/78.
In both series the differences between males
and females were never more than 7 mm. Hg.
From observation of 102 Chelsea pensioners
over 75 years of age Thompson and Todd
found that the average blood pressure was
145 systolic / 80 diastolic, estimations varying from 190/100
to 115/70, and that the average pulse pressure,
or difference between the systolic and diastolic
pressures, was 67 mm. They came to the conclusion
that it was not possible to arrive at a normal
blood pressure for old people on account of
the varying conditions of the heart and arteries.<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">190</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
The urine, in consequence of the lowered
metabolism and general atrophy, is somewhat
diminished in quantity with a fall in the solids,
though the specific gravity remains about
normal. The chlorides are stated to be normal
and the phosphates and urea to be diminished.
Slight glycosuria as a result of a low sugar
tolerance (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">vide</i> Spence<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">191</a>) is not uncommon,
especially in obesity. Prolonged confinement to
bed has been thought to be responsible for casts
in the urine. A trace of albumin is not rare;
this may be due to various factors, and in itself
is not a cause for anxiety; but a well-marked
fall in the specific gravity is a sign of renal
inadequacy which may be preceded and anticipated
by the discovery of nitrogen retention
in the blood.</p>

<p><i>Sexual activity</i> in man wanes generally speaking
after 50, but there are great variations in this
respect, and sometimes there are periods of considerable
excitement in old men, often thought
to be associated with prostatic enlargement.</p>

<p>It would naturally be expected that <em>wounds</em>
and <em>fractures</em> of bones would heal more slowly
in the old than in the young, and, according
to Carrel and Ebeling,<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">192</a> the cicatrization of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
human wounds varies inversely, if accurately
measured, with the age of the patient; Humphry,
however, found that, provided sloughing did
not occur, wounds and ulcers in the aged heal
as quickly as in middle life, and that the failure
of union in intracapsular fracture of the neck
of the femur is due to want of apposition and
not to the age of the patient.</p>

<p>In some respects the <em>reaction to drugs</em> in
the senescent body is different from that in
ordinary adult life. In old people absorption
from the alimentary canal is slow and this is
particularly so with gelatin-coated pills and
drugs, such as cinchona, containing tannin,
which should therefore be avoided. The
physiological response to drugs is slower and
more prolonged than in early life, so that for
this reason and from the frequency of constipation
an accumulated action is thought to
be more likely to occur in the aged. It is
sometimes said that large doses are not borne
well by the old and that morphine is dangerous
as it is in infants, but Nascher<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">193</a> states that if,
in order to obviate the paralysing effect of
morphine on a weakened respiratory centre,
atropine is given before the morphine so that
their action can be timed to coincide, instead<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
of giving them at the same time when the
effect of the atropine comes later, morphine
can be given in the same doses as in maturity.
Purgatives may be required in larger doses
than in ordinary practice. According to
Leonard Williams<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">194</a> bromides are likely to
produce mental confusion in old people and
if persisted in, even in ordinary doses, may
be followed by vascular thrombosis and permanent
impairment of the intellectual powers.
Sedatives and hypnotics when necessary should
be given in small doses and discontinued as
soon as possible; but they may be necessary
for restlessness which would otherwise seriously
exhaust the failing strength.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE DESCRIPTION OF OLD AGE IN
THE TWELFTH CHAPTER OF ECCLESIASTES</span></h2>
</div>

<p>When first approaching the subject of old age
every one must recall the famous description in
the first six verses of the twelfth chapter of
Ecclesiastes beginning “Remember now thy
Creator in the days of thy youth while the evil
days come not, nor the years draw nigh when
thou shalt say I have no pleasure in them.”
Formerly ascribed to King Solomon (977 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>)
the book of Ecclesiastes (in Hebrew Koheleth
= the preacher) has been shown by the higher
criticism to date only from the end of the third
century <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>, and from internal evidence,
namely references to the brain, spinal cord, and
other anatomical structures, though expressed
with poetic imagery, it may fairly be assumed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
that a medical man was concerned with its
construction. In his attractive work, <cite>A Gentle
Cynic</cite>,<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">195</a> the late Professor Morris Jastrow, jun.,
of Philadelphia explained that the book of
Ecclesiastes as it appears in the authorized
version, consists of (i.) the original, cynical, but
good-natured <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">obiter dicta</i> of the unknown
dilettante who preferred to veil his identity
under the name of Koheleth, and (ii.) additions
and modifications made by various hands to
render it more orthodox and compatible with
the tradition that it was written by Solomon;
thus the admonition “of making books there
is no end and much study is a weariness of the
flesh” may very probably have been intended
as a hint that Koheleth’s views should not be
taken too seriously. Following this conception
Jastrow reconstructed the text of the book
of Ecclesiastes to what he argued was its
original form, and compared it with the more
modern writings of Omar Kháyyám and Heinrich
Heine. As we all must have speculated
over the correct interpretation of the various
metaphors in this description of the last stage
of life, the explanations offered by others, such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
as Andreas Laurentius (1599),<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">196</a> Master Peter
Lowe (1612),<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">197</a> founder of the Faculty of
Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow, Bishop
J. Hall (1633),<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">198</a> John Smith (1665),<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">199</a> Richard
Mead (1775),<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">200</a> and Jastrow may be very briefly
mentioned. The second verse, “While the
sun, or the light, or the moon, or the stars,
be not darkened, nor the clouds return after
the rain,” is regarded by Laurentius, Lowe,
and Hall as referring to the ocular disabilities
of old age, whereas Smith and Mead consider
that mental failure and depression
are meant. As regards the third verse,
“In the day when the keepers of the
house (the hands) shall tremble, and the
strong men (the legs) shall bow themselves
(become bent), and the grinders (teeth) cease
because they are few, and those that look
out of the windows (the eyes) be darkened,”
there is general agreement, Lowe specially
designating cataract as meant in the last sentence.
“And the doors shall be shut in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
streets,” is regarded as referring to the mouth
by Laurentius and Mead, and to the various
orifices including the results—constipation and
dysuria—by Smith; “when the sound of the
grinding is low,” is considered by Jastrow to
mean impaired hearing, and by Smith as a
lowered rate of metabolic processes, such as
assimilation, blood formation, and various
secretions. “And he shall rise up at the voice
of the bird,” implies, according to Smith and
Mead, the early waking of the elderly; “and
all the daughters of music shall be brought
low” signifies to Laurentius the failure of
voice, to Mead deafness, and to Smith all the
organs concerned with sounds, namely the lips,
tongue, larynx, and the auditory apparatus.
“Also when they shall be afraid of that which
is high, and fears shall be in the way” is
regarded by Smith as describing the general
mental attitude of anxiety for things both small
and great and a bad head for height, but a more
modern commentator suggests that “afraid of
that which is high” refers to dyspnoea on
climbing a hill. “And the almond tree shall
flourish” is by Laurentius, Hall, and Smith
thought to refer to the white hair or “churchyard
flowers” of the old, but Mead argued
that loss of smell is meant. “And the grasshopper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
shall be a burden” has been very
variously interpreted: Hall is content to accept
the literal meaning that the least weight is a
nuisance; Laurentius and Lowe understand
oedema of the legs; John Smith that the aged
body undergoes the reverse change of shrivelling,
hardening, and angularity; Mead suggests
scrotal hernia, and Jastrow, as according
to the Talmud the grasshopper is a symbol
for the male sexual organ, considers that the
sentence refers to the loss of sexual activity.
In the sixth verse the words “Or ever the silver
cord be loosed,” refers, according to Laurentius,
Lowe, Mead, and Jastrow, to kyphosis, but
Smith translates them into paralysis of the
spinal cord and nerves. “Or the golden bowl
be broken,” signifies cardiac failure to Laurentius
and Lowe, but cerebral haemorrhage to
Smith, who thus explains the next line, “or
the pitcher (the veins) be broken at the fountain
(the right ventricle), or the wheel (the arterial
circulation) broken at the cistern” (the left
ventricle), and therefore concludes that King
Solomon was perfectly acquainted with the
circulation of the blood discovered by William
Harvey in 1616. “The pitcher” is regarded
as the vena cava by Laurentius, and as the
urinary bladder by Mead and Jastrow; “the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
wheel broken at the cistern” suggests the
kidneys and bladder to Laurentius and Lowe,
cardiac failure to Mead, and intestinal and
hepatic insufficiency to Jastrow.</p>

<span class="subhead">DISTINCTION BETWEEN HEALTHY
AND MORBID OLD AGE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>In any individual instance the exact line which
separates healthy old age (senescence) from old
age complicated by a morbid process, <i>i.e.</i> by
some factor other than the gradual atrophy and
restriction of functional activity, or senility,
may be difficult or impossible to draw. The
dictum of Terence, Cicero, and Sanatorius that
old age is a disease probably still finds acceptance
with many. It is indeed clear that exposures
to infections and poisons would produce
changes more easily in cells that are beginning
to fail in vitality. Healthy old age should be a
normal process of involution with progressive
atrophy and loss of vitality, and free from any
morbid change due to other factors whether
extrinsic, such as infection, or intrinsic and due
to abnormal metabolism. As the bodies of
the aged usually show a number of changes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
additional to those of normal involution, some
of which, such as arteriosclerosis, are so frequent
that they have sometimes been erroneously
regarded as part or even the cause of old age,
it is essential to recognize and to try to draw a
distinction between physiological old age and
senility from the effects of disease (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Senium ex
morbo</i>). But about the anatomy and physiology
of normal old age much remains to be learnt;
more indeed is known about the pathology of
the aged, a subject which includes the damage
done in the past, perhaps in youth, and morbid
processes starting during advanced life.</p>

<p>In attempting to decide when old age should
be regarded as a disease or merely as a process
of involution or retrogression which naturally
follows the earlier and progressive stage (youth)
of development, it may be well to refer to the
meaning of “disease” and “health.” Disease,
or want of ease, has been variously defined as
evidence of imperfect function, as discord, and
as maladjustment between the individual and
his environment (Moon<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">201</a>), and Health as the
indication of perfect functional activity, as
harmony between the individual and his environment.
In the different stages of life’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
cycle there should be a correspondence between
the individual’s desires and his powers so that
there is harmonious co-ordination; this should
hold good in normal old age as it does in youth.</p>

<p>The frequent complaints of old people show
that there is maladjustment and disease, for if
the decline of vitality were uniform throughout
the body the equilibrium would, though
altered as a whole, still be maintained, and there
would no longer be a discordant desire for
activity, for which other parts of the body are,
from a more advanced state of atrophy or
morbid change, unable. Thus it would appear
that the conscious disabilities of old age are
not the necessary results of a true physiological
involution, and that the late Sir Andrew
Clark’s definition of Old Age as “the period
at which a man ceases to adjust himself to his
environment” should be regarded as true of
senility or morbid old age but not of senescence
or healthy old age.</p>

<p>The organs of the body do not all start to
grow old at the same time or progress at the
same time. That such variations in involution
may be so exaggerated as to become morbid
without any very obvious cause is highly probable,
but the latter event is clearly a departure
from the progress of normal old age. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
precocious atrophy of some tissues or organs
may be ascribed to several factors, such as
inherent weakness, the effects of overstrain,
though without producing gross changes, or
to the influence of a definite infection or
intoxication in the past. Thus deafness may
be hereditary, senile paraplegia has been known
to occur in energetic walkers, and thyroid
deficiency may be the outcome of a past attack
of enteric fever. These errors in the chronometry
of life, as Sir James Paget<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">202</a> termed the
different ageing of organs, cannot be regarded
as a physiological process.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="X" class="vspace">X<br />

<span class="subhead">DISEASES IN AND OF OLD AGE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Strictly speaking, it cannot be said that there
are any diseases special to length of days, for
premature senility shows the changes and
diseases usually correlated with ordinary old
age. Inherent want of vitality and the resulting
degenerative atrophy, or Gowers’s abiotrophy,
may imitate the results of prolonged
wear and tear of the tissues, and thus it appears
that Charcot’s<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">203</a> group of diseases special to
old age, namely senile marasmus, senile
osteomalacia, senile atrophy of the brain, senile
heart weakness, and arteriosclerosis, are not
confined to senescence. Old age, however,
is prone to the incidence of diseases which are
chiefly but not exclusively seen in the evening
of life, such as those due to the degenerative
changes resulting from the accumulated effect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
of past infections and from metabolic disturbance.
Thus arteriosclerosis, granular kidney,
cardiac failure, cerebral haemorrhage, emphysema,
hepatic cirrhosis, prostatic enlargement,
and carcinoma commonly appear in the sixth
decade. In a series of five publications dealing
with the diseases of the age of fifty, which he
calls the critical age, Leclercq<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">204</a> describes, in
addition to some of the above, gout and paragouty
affections, obesity, diabetes, cardio-aortic
diseases, and albuminuria. Old age, moreover,
modifies the manifestations and course of
infections, notably of pneumonia and erysipelas.
It would be unnecessary and from reasons of
space impossible to refer to all the diseases
that may attack the aged, but a few remarks
will be made about some disorders that appear
to call for special notice.</p>

<p>Senescence has some nosological compensations;
thus some acute infections, such as
measles, scarlet fever, enteric fever, and diphtheria,
are very rare, probably because immunity
has gradually been developed in the
course of time; pneumonia and erysipelas,
however, are notable exceptions in being
specially prone to occur in the aged. Migraine
usually becomes less troublesome or disappears<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
with the march of years. As mentioned on
p. 86, malignant disease is comparatively rare
in very advanced age; lymphadenoma and
leukaemia are rarer than in early life; and
as pathological, like normal, processes are
slower, carcinoma, especially of the breast,
may become stationary.</p>

<p><i>Diseases of the Skin.</i>—From atrophy of the
skin and its secretory glands the skin is less
resistant to infection and accordingly has been
thought to be more susceptible to parasitic
attack, such as pityriasis versicolor. The aged
who are often less scrupulous in cleanliness
than their juniors are more prone to skin
affections, such as eczema, erythema, and
erysipelas. The so-called senile prurigo is
largely due to the presence of lice. From the
atrophic condition of the skin the cutaneous
nerves are more exposed, and this has been
regarded as playing a causal part in senile
pruritus, which is an exception to the general
rule that sensory impressions are less prominent
in the aged than earlier in life. It may, like
prurigo, be due to an external cause, such as
pediculi, or it may be metabolic in origin.
In almshouses and institutions for the aged
epidemics of scratching may develop from
imitation of a genuine case of pruritus. Senile<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
pruritus is usually general and from its obstinate
resistance to treatment may be a terrible affliction.
Sir Gilbert Blane (1749–1834) suffered
from it for the last 13 years of his life, and was
obliged to take opium in increasing quantities
until his daily dose reached the equivalent of a
dram of the solid drug.</p>

<p>Erysipelas, like pneumonia, with which or
with bronchopneumonia it may be combined,
is less obvious in its symptoms than in ordinary
adult life on account of the diminished
power of reaction, as shown by the slight degree
of leucocytosis in the aged in erysipelas
(Lamy) and by its longer course. From want
of resistance and arteriosclerosis, especially
Mönckeberg’s form with calcification of the
media, senile gangrene may follow slight
accident or injury, such as occurs in cutting
the toe nails. Absorption from the gangrenous
area may cause toxic glycosuria, and such cases,
when they come under observation at this stage,
are sometimes regarded as diabetic gangrene.
It is remarkable how well amputations for diabetic
gangrene do; in July 1922 I saw with
Professor F. H. Edgeworth a man with double
amputation of the legs perfectly healed, and in
good health though the glycosuria persisted.</p>

<p>Herpes zoster, though far from confined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
to advanced life, has in the old the unfortunate
tendency to leave persistent pain in its site.
Rodent ulcer, although sometimes seen comparatively
early in life, is specially common in
advanced years. It often supervenes on the
dry yellow or brown spots (senile keratosis)
seen on the face in persons over 60 years of age.</p>

<p><i>Vertigo</i> is extremely common in later life
and may be due to various causes; the most
frequent form is that of aural origin, such as
labyrinthine or nerve lesions and chronic
changes in the middle ear. Increased blood
pressure and cerebral arteriosclerosis are frequently
responsible. Attacks of giddiness may
occur in Stokes-Adams disease or follow exertion
in the aged, as if from cerebral anaemia;
and gastric disturbance may apparently also
be a determining factor. In rare instances
epilepsy or migraine may be represented or
initiated by vertigo.</p>

<p><i>Senile tremor</i>, rare under the age of 70,
begins in the hands, especially in that most
used, and spreads to the neck and head, rarely
occurring in the lower limbs. It is a slow
intention tremor, from 4 to 5 per second, and
is distinguished by its relation to movement
from that of paralysis agitans which is continuous
but diminished on muscular contraction.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
The tremor of the jaw resembles that of
munching food; that of the lips is fine. It
is compatible with good health.</p>

<p><i>Paralysis agitans</i>, described by James Parkinson,
surgeon and palaeontologist, in 1817 as
“the Shaking Palsy,” has now about a century
later been shown, largely as a result of S. A. K.
Wilson’s work, to be one of the forms of the
extra-pyramidal symptom complex and due to
degenerative changes in the efferent motor
system of the globus pallidus system. Although
juvenile forms occur and encephalitis lethargica
may show the Parkinsonian syndrome, paralysis
agitans is a disease of the early part of the later
period of life, the great majority of the cases
beginning between 50 and 70 (Gowers<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">205</a>),
after which there is a small incidence only.
It is twice as common in males as in females.
Though unfortunately, from the degenerative
nature of the lesion, incurable, it is a chronic
disease; thus Maclachlan<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">206</a> refers to a Chelsea
pensioner aged 107 years in whom it was
known to have existed for 47 years.</p>

<p>Vascular lesions, haemorrhage or thrombosis,
are the most important factors in the production<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
of grave nervous disease between the ages of
50 and 70; among 500 cases of cerebral
haemorrhage 321, or 64 per cent, and of 110
cases of cerebral thrombosis 67, or 61 per cent,
occurred in the sixth and seventh decades
(Michell Clarke<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">207</a>). <i>Cerebral haemorrhage</i> increases
with frequency from the fourth decade
and the largest number of cases occur between
50 and 60. From analysis of 154 cases at
St. Bartholomew’s Hospital F. W. Andrewes<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">208</a>
found that the apparent maximum is in the
middle of the sixth decade, but that correction
for the age distribution of the population
shows that the liability of the individual to
this form of death increases steadily up to
old age. <em>Thrombosis of atheromatous vessels</em> is
an accident of later incidence than cerebral
haemorrhage, and thus contrasts with hemiplegia
due to syphilitic endarteritis which
occurs about the prime of life.</p>

<p>The physiological involution of the mind
and accompanying organic changes in the
brain gradually shade off into senile dementia.
A regression to the mental state of childhood,
which Dupré<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">209</a> called puerilism, may occur in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
widely different conditions, such as structural
change of the brain, hysteria, and toxaemia.
It may be acute and be transient or come on
slowly and be permanent. Just as an old
man may relapse into the speech and accent
of his youth, so if he had a hard pecuniary
struggle in his early days may he become
miserly in the evening of his life.</p>

<p><i>Senile dementia</i> is an exaggeration of the
mental changes occurring in old age and due
to further changes in the brain from vascular
disease or toxic influences. It varies much
in its features; some patients are maniacal,
others depressed and melancholic, some feeble,
some delusional, and a few immoral. The
senile mania may be mainly nocturnal and
was compared by Clouston<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">210</a> to the night
delirium of a febrile neurotic child; it may
pass into dementia. Of the melancholic group
in which suicide may occur Clouston found
that 30 per cent recovered.</p>

<p><i>Senile paraplegia</i> may be divided into four
etiological groups: (1) The functional dysbasias
or pseudo-paraplegias described by Marie
and Léri,<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">211</a> which in general terms resemble<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
those met with during adult life, but the
varieties are less distinct in the old. Quesnel<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">212</a>
recognizes three groups of functional disturbance
of walking in old people: (<i>a</i>) the slight
and usually curable, (<i>b</i>) severe functional disturbance
depending essentially on the mental
state of the patient, and (<i>c</i>) the organo-functional
in which a bony, articular, or nervous lesion is
present; thus confinement to bed for a fracture
may cause a functional paraplegia. (2) Spastic
paraplegia due to sclerosis in the lateral and
posterior columns of the spinal cord; the
influence of arteriosclerosis, as advocated by
Oppenheim, has been the subject of some
debate, and Lejonne and Lhermitte point out
that the nervous lesions are not necessarily
perivascular and that there is a want of proportion
between the vascular and the nervous
changes. (3) Paraplegia of cerebral origin
with descending degeneration in the cord and
mental deterioration. (4) Paraplegia from
muscular fibrosis and contracture, the central
nervous system being intact.</p>

<p>From the presence of emphysema bronchitis
is prone to occur in the old. <i>Lobar pneumonia
and bronchopneumonia.</i> Lobar pneumonia has
always been considered the great enemy of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
the aged; it is often latent, and may be found
after sudden death and in persons supposed
to have died of old age, because they were
walking about or complained not at all or only
of trivial symptoms. In spite of Charcot’s<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">213</a>
considered opinion to the contrary, it is probable
that pneumonia has been often used to describe
what was really bronchopneumonia. For
Roussy and Leroux<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">214</a> found that among 300
necropsies at the Hospice Paul Brousse there
were 164 cases, or 55 per cent, of bronchopneumonia
and only 4 cases, or 1·4 per cent,
of lobar pneumonia. The bronchopneumonic
areas are triangular with the base towards the
pleural surface, and indeed are infarcts, due
to pre-existing endarteritis obliterans which
disposes to secondary infection. In 110 out
of the 164 cases of bronchopneumonia there
was arterial thrombosis, which was of older
date than the infected areas of infarction and
bronchopneumonia.</p>

<p><i>Senile tuberculosis</i>, contrary to what has sometimes
been stated, is fairly common though it is
often latent; a patient with pulmonary tuberculosis
may have little or no cough, expectoration,
fever, or night sweats, and the physical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
signs, if present, may be regarded as those of
bronchitis and emphysema or bronchiectasis,
unless the sputum is available and examined
for bacilli. Such unrecognized cases are an
obvious danger in institutions, and it may be
added that hereditary disposition plays a much
less important part in the aged than in early
life. Senile tuberculosis, however, is usually
either a persistence of that infection or a recrudescence
of quiescent infection, and is
seldom primary. The disease may be chronic
or acute, and either local or generalized.</p>

<p>The <i>senile heart</i> has attracted much attention,
and myocardial degeneration and fibrosis
due to past infections or to coronary arteriosclerosis
are extremely common. The myocardial
change is of great importance in reducing
the reserve power of the heart, so that cardiac
failure is prone to supervene in acute infections,
such as influenzal pneumonia. Chronic
valvulitis akin to and associated with arteriosclerosis
is common; the mitral valve is often
affected and incompetent, with a loud systolic
murmur at the apex which is displaced outwards;
but the most characteristic lesion of advanced
years is pure aortic stenosis; this is commonly
regarded as part of the arteriosclerotic process
in the aorta, but, as I have often noticed, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
aorta may be remarkably healthy and even
thinner than usual in old people with extensive
calcification of the valves reducing the aortic
orifice to a chink; it has indeed been thought
that such stenosis of the aortic valves may
protect the aorta from strain and so from
arteriosclerosis. Although involvement of the
bundle of His giving rise to the symptom
complex of Stokes-Adams disease, and angina
pectoris may complicate aortic stenosis, the
presence of this valvular defect is compatible
with remarkable prolongation of life. This
may be due to the more placid life of these old
patients, as is suggested by Sir Clifford Allbutt,<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">215</a>
who regards aortic stenosis as more unfavourable
in persons under 55 years of age than in
their elders.</p>

<p><i>Aneurysm of the large arteries</i> is rare in the
aged, although arteriosclerosis is common.
Diffuse dilatation especially of the arch of the
aorta and of the common iliacs is not infrequent,
and occasionally latent saccular aneurysms are
present. In rare instances large abdominal
aneurysms causing pain or remaining latent
until rupture occurs are reported. Among
112 abdominal aneurysms collected by Nunneley<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">216</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
15 were over 50 years of age; these figures
included 32 from St. George’s Hospital, three
of them being over 65 years of age. Miliary
aneurysms are of course extremely common in
the subjects of cerebral haemorrhage.</p>

<p><i>Spasm</i>, especially of arteriosclerotic vessels,
may be responsible for attacks of giddiness or
faintness, particularly on exertion, and there
may be some doubt whether such symptoms
are the outcome of cerebral anaemia or of
cardiac insufficiency. Frequent transient attacks
of aphasia or paralysis, due to spasm of
arteriosclerotic middle cerebral arteries, may
occur in patients with high blood pressure
(Peabody,<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">217</a> Osler<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">218</a>).</p>

<p><i>Varicosity</i> either localized, like aneurysms,
or throughout the length of veins, are common,
especially in the lower limbs of women who
have borne children and done much standing;
this condition disposes to varicose ulcers in
the lower third of the leg, and to acute phlebitis.
As pointed out by Trousseau, who was an
illustration of his own dictum, venous thrombosis
may occur in the course of intra-abdominal
malignant disease.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
Though <i>dyspepsia</i> of adult life often diminishes
or passes away in the more tranquil conditions
of old age, it is common; Fenwick<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">219</a>
estimated that it occurred in 21 per cent of the
population over the age of 65. Oral sepsis
may be responsible for chronic gastritis and
much debility in the old. <em>Constipation</em> often
comes on after 60 and is mainly due to atonic
dilatation and failure of peristalsis in the colon,
though diminished secretion of mucus may
play a part. Prostatic enlargement has been
thought to interfere with peristalsis (Hollis<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">220</a>),
and in women large fibromyomas of the uterus
may have this effect. Gerontal constipation is
usually more troublesome in women than in
men. Faecal accumulation in the rectum is a
frequent cause, especially in bed-ridden subjects,
of what they describe as diarrhoea, the real
significance of which may be easily overlooked
unless digital examination of the rectum is
undertaken. The pecten band of fibrous tissue
arising in the submucosa of the pecten, inside
the external sphincter, narrows the anal orifice
and so prevents complete evacuation of the
rectum and diminishes the size of the faeces
which are generally voided in short pieces. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
is usually, but not always, associated with
internal piles and due to the attendant congestion.
W. E. Miles,<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">221</a> who described the
pecten band, tells me that it may be regarded
as a pathological development of advancing
years, and that he has found that it may so
reduce the anal orifice in the elderly that it
is with difficulty the little finger can be
introduced. Pruritus ani, due to piles and
local congestion, is not uncommon in the aged.</p>

<p><i>Piles</i> are common in the aged and are
related to the frequency of constipation. Like
other diseases, they do not give rise to discomfort
so soon or so forcibly as in younger
persons. From muscular atrophy hernia,
umbilical in both sexes, in men inguinal and
in women femoral, is prone to occur.</p>

<p><i>Gallstones</i> are more frequent in advanced
life, especially in women, than at other times
of life, gallstones being found after death in
about a third of persons over 70 years of age,
though, as mentioned elsewhere, biliary colic
is comparatively rare in old age.</p>

<p>The <i>urinary bladder</i> in cases of prostatic
enlargement shows hypertrophy succeeded by
dilatation, fasciculation, and sacculation in
response to the obstruction to micturition and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
degeneration of the muscular fibres. The
ureters in similar circumstances become dilated,
and the incidence of cystitis and pyelonephritis
is thus favoured.</p>

<p><i>Arthritic Affections.</i>—Although gout is due
to a defect in protein metabolism analogous to
diabetes mellitus as regards carbohydrate metabolism
and to obesity as a manifestation of
disordered metabolism of fat, reference to this
disease may be made here. Heredity has a
potent influence on the incidence of the disease
particularly in early life, but acquired gout is
essentially a disease of the latter part of life or
the early stage of old age when degeneration
is beginning. The first attack may not occur
until old age, and is then usually mild in
character, and, in Sir William Roberts’s<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">222</a> words,
appears almost as if it were an incidence of
senescence. How far the various conditions
spoken of as irregular gout, goutiness, or
paragouty diseases, which are so numerous as
to recall Murchison’s lithaemia, should be
regarded as gouty is uncertain, but that they
depend on disordered protein metabolism is
highly probable. The connexion of gout with
infection, as urged by Llewellyn,<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">223</a> has a bearing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
on the fibrositis and Dupuytren’s contraction
often regarded as gouty phenomena. Dupuytren’s
contraction of the palmar fascia,
which has been thought in some instances to
be secondary to arteriosclerosis of the medulla
oblongata (Jardini<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">224</a>), often accompanies the
fibrous pads on the interphalangeal joints of
the fingers described by Garrod<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">225</a> and Hale-White.<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">226</a>
The tendency of focal infections,
especially oral sepsis, to become more frequent
with advancing years also has a distinct bearing
on the occurrence of chronic infective arthritis
of various forms. The most characteristic is
morbus coxae senilis which is not uncommonly
associated with Heberden’s nodi digitorum,
and sometimes with Morrant Baker’s cysts due
to distension of synovial bursae with fluid; it
may be confused with sciatica. Heberden’s
nodes are unimportant and commonly free from
attendant symptoms.</p>

<p>Spondylitis deformans with ankylosis of the
articulations and ossification of the ligaments of
the spine, in some cases further complicated
by an extension of the process to the proximal
joints of the limbs (rhizomelic spondylitis), may
occur in the aged though also earlier in life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
<i>Osteitis deformans</i> or Paget’s disease of bone
begins as a rule in the later half of life, the
average age being 50 years. Lannelonge<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">227</a>
and Fournier<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">228</a> argued that it is a lesion due
to congenital syphilis; but although luetic
periostitis and osteitis may imitate it, there
is no convincing evidence in favour of their
contention.</p>

clinical signs of liver disease, drawn from his own large

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
